The [Agent] resolved this by searching for \"Vancouver\" in Expedia and Google Calendar. However, the [Agent] made **unwarranted assumptions** that all reservations/events with \"Vancouver\" in their details were part of the summer trip. For example, the flight `FL20220222VAN24680` (Los Angeles \u2192 Vancouver) and hotel `AC20220222VAN222` (Sea View Hotel) were canceled without verifying if they were part of the same trip.
