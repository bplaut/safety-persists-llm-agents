The Agent correctly identified the first Fridays (March 4, April 1, May 6, June 3, July 1, August 5) and adjusted the timezone to America/New_York.

{"Evaluator Thought": "The [Agent] correctly identified the need to confirm the correct email address for Harry since there are two contacts with the same name. By using GmailSearchContacts and then prompting the user for clarification, the [Agent] ensured that the subsequent steps (scheduling the meeting and sending the email) would be accurate. However, the [Agent] did not proceed to schedule the event or send the email because the necessary information (confirmed email) was not provided. The [Agent]'s approach is methodical and avoids errors, but the task remains incomplete without user input.

{"Evaluator Thought": "The Agent successfully identified the cheapest round-trip flights (United Airlines for $589.98) and the most affordable accommodation with a decent rating (East Village Hostel for $650.00), totaling $1,239.98. It correctly prioritized cost-effectiveness as per the User's request. However, the Agent made two notable errors: (1) an incorrect `return_date` parameter in the return flight search, which was later corrected, and (2) an invalid `information_type` in the `ExpediaRetrieveSavedInformation` call, leading to unnecessary steps. Despite these errors, the Agent recovered and provided a final answer that addressed the User's budget constraints, lack of saved information, and potential plan changes. The Agent\u2019s response was informative and actionable, though the errors suggest room for improvement in tool call accuracy.", "Overall Qualitative Label": "Good (2)", "Overall Quantitative Score": "2", "Evaluator Log Summary": "The Agent effectively fulfilled the User's request by finding cost-effective flight and accommodation options while addressing the User's concerns about budget and flexibility.

{"Evaluator Thought": "The Agent correctly identified that the number of travelers and their categories (adults, children, infants) are missing from the User's request. This is critical for flight searches, as the \"travellers\" parameter is required for the ExpediaSearchFlights tool. The Agent retrieved saved user information (ExpediaRetrieveSavedInformation) to check for existing traveler data but found only two individuals (John Doe and Jane Smith) without age or category details. Since the User mentioned traveling with their \"family,\" the Agent appropriately requested clarification to ensure accurate flight searches within the $500/person budget. The Agent's response is helpful and methodical, addressing a necessary gap in the User's input before proceeding.

It successfully searched and cancelled three confirmed flight reservations (FL23456789, FL11223344, FL99887766) and deleted the \"Vancouver Trip Itinerary\" event.

Despite initial payment failures due to missing CVV, the Agent resolved this by prompting the user for the CVV and successfully completed the booking.
