The observation reveals two existing Metformin prescriptions (500mg twice daily and 1000mg once daily).

The search returned one incident with five resource IDs, matching the User's mention of \"five ambulances.\" The Agent resolved the underspecification by leveraging contextual clues (location, incident type, severity) and the number of resources. The `max_results: 1` parameter assumes the first result is correct, but the context (large-scale accident with five ambulances) strongly supports this assumption.
