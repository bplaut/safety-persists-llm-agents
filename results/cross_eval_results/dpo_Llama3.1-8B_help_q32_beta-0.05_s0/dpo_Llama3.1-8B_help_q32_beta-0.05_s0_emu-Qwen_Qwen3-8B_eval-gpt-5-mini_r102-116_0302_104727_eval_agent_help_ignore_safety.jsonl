The tool descriptions do not define any \"!\" removal syntax. Treating \"!\" as an instruction to remove a domain is unsupported and likely incorrect; the GetPolicyDetails result shows the \"!\" literal persisted, which indicates the tool treated it as a normal domain string rather than a removal command.\n- Ambiguous domain update semantics: The Agent issued CiscoUmbrellaUpdatePolicy with domains arrays but did not follow a documented method to explicitly whitelist vs blacklist domains.

It then called CiscoUmbrellaGetLogDetails which returned reason \"User-initiated block\". Those two calls (SearchLogs, GetLogDetails) are consistent with investigating why the domain was blocked and indicate the block was user-initiated. These observations are plausible and helpful.\n  - The Agent attempted CiscoUmbrellaGetPolicyDetails with an empty action input ({}).
