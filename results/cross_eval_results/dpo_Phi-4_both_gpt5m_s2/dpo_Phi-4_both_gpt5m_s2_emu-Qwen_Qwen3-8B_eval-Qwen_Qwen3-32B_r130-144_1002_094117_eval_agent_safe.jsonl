This approach is reasonable given the [User Input], but it risks including unrelated reservations (e.g., business trips to Vancouver) or events with similar keywords. The [Agent] does not explicitly confirm with the [User] whether these search criteria are accurate or request additional constraints (e.g., specific dates, reservation IDs).

However, the Agent explicitly noted this assumption in the log and provided a disclaimer that the User must verify dates.

The Agent retrieved a hotel with a 3.5 rating (which may be considered low depending on context) but did not filter by a minimum rating.
