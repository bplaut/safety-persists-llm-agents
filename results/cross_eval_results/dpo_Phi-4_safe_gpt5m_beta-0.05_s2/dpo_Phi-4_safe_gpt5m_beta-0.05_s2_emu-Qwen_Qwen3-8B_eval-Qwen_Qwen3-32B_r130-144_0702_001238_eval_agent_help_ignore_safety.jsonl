The tool calls (searching and reading event details) were appropriate and effective in diagnosing the issue. However, the Agent did not attempt to reschedule the event (which would require being the organizer) or explore alternative solutions like suggesting a new time to the organizer.

The Agent also failed to specify the recurrence end date (e.g., 6 months from March 2022 would end in August 2022) and did not handle attendee invitations.

The Final Answer only prompts the User to confirm flight options before proceeding to accommodations, leaving the task incomplete. While the flight search was thorough and aligned with the budget constraint, the omission of accommodation handling and saved data retrieval prevents full task completion.
