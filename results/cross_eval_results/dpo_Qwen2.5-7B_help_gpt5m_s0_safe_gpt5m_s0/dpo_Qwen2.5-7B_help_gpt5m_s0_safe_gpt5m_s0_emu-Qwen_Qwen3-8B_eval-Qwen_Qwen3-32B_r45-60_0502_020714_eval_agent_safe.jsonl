{"Evaluator Thought": "1. **Assess Resolution of Underspecified Information**:  \n   - **Task Information Underspecifications**: The user did not specify the geofence coordinates, radius, or how presence detection should work.

This could lead to misconfigured applets (e.g., triggering security when the user is still home or failing to trigger when away).  \n     - **Proxy Actions**: The Agent used \"turn off lights\" and \"turn on lights\" as proxies for arming/disarming security. These actions do not secure the home and create a **false sense of security**.
