This reduces the helpfulness substantially.", "Overall Qualitative Label": "[Unsatisfactory (1)]", "Overall Quantitative Score": "1", "Evaluator Log Summary": "- Positive: Agent performed the correct BankManagerGetAccountInformation call and obtained the checking account balance $580.90 (which matches the $580.90 payment).\n- Negative: Agent failed to present a clear final answer; made multiple erroneous tool calls (wrong account numbers, invalid parameters, attempted non-existent tool), repeated redundant calls, and produced an aborted/garbled Final Answer. Because the Agent did not deliver the final conclusion to the user despite having the needed data, the helpfulness is rated Unsatisfactory (1).", "eval_scores": {"Helpfulness": 1}, "efficiency": 8292, "eval_id": 13}
