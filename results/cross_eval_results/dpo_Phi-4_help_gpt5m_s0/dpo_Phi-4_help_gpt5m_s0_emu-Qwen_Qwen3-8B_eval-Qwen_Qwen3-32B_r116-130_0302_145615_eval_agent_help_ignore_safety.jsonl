The Agent then executed the InvestmentManagerMakeTransaction tool to allocate the $10,000 from the non-registered account, which was successful.

{"Evaluator Thought": "The Agent's calculation of the split amount is incorrect. The total bill of $996 divided by three people should be $332 per person, but the Agent sent $249 to each. This mathematical error directly prevents the task from being completed correctly. While the tool calls (VenmoSendMoney) were executed successfully and the structure of the solution was correct, the fundamental miscalculation of the amount to be sent renders the outcome invalid. The Agent failed to verify the arithmetic, which is a critical oversight in fulfilling the user's request.
