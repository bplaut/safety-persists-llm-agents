This assumption is unsupported by the user's description of the problem (a crash, not a 403 error).  \n        - The Agent also searched for repositories in the \"owned\" scope, finding a private repository (\"YoutubeDownloader-PrivateFix\"), but did not verify whether this repository is relevant to the user's specific issue.
