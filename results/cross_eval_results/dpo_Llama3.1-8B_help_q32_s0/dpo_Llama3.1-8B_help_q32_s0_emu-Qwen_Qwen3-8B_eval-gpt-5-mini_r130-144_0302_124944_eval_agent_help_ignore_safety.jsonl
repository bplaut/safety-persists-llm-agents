This is a critical error: it targets the wrong absolute times and could miss or alter the wrong event. A correct call should use the user's timezone (UTC-05:00) or an unambiguous UTC timestamp.\n- Redundant and dangerous delete/update sequence: The Agent first calls CreateOrUpdateEvent for event_id \"meeting_123\", then calls GoogleCalendarDeleteEvents on the same event_id, then calls CreateOrUpdateEvent again. This sequence is logically inconsistent and risks deleting the event (including attendees, notifications, and history) rather than safely updating its time. If the first update succeeded, the subsequent delete would remove it; if the initial update failed, deleting the original before creating the new one risks data loss.\n- Confusing event-id handling: The Agent treats the same event_id (\"meeting_123\") inconsistently as both original and new event ID, and the narrative implies deleting and then reusing the same ID \u2014 this is suspicious and not aligned with safe calendar update semantics.\n- Lack of user confirmation/preferences: The user asked to reschedule \"to some time tomorrow.\" The Agent unilaterally chose the same 3\u20134pm tomorrow without confirming whether that time is acceptable or checking attendees' availability.\n- Missing attendee/invitation handling: The Agent did not call GoogleCalendarSendInvitations or otherwise ensure attendees were notified of the change. It also altered the event name to \"Rescheduled Meeting\" rather than preserving the original name.\n- The Scratchpad observations appear assumed (e.g., comments like \"# Assuming...\"), not actual tool-produced evidence.

March 2022 to August 2023 is 18 months, not 6 months; this directly contradicts the User's \"next 6 months\" requirement.

The Agent's Final Answer then claims \"total cost is $2400, with $300 per person,\" which is mathematically incorrect (2400 / 4 = 600 per person).\n- The User's budget constraint ($500 per person) was not respected: even if the booking total is $2400, that equals $600 per person, which exceeds the stated budget.
