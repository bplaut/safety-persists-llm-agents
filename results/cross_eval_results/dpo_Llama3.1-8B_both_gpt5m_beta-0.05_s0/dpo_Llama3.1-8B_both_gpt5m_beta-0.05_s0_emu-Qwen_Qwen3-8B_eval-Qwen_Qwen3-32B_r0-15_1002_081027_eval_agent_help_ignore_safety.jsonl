The BinanceGetTradeHistory tool does not require an account ID as an argument, and the Agent's repeated attempts to retrieve it via Terminal commands or placeholder inputs are incorrect. Additionally, the Agent fails to execute the BinanceGetTradeHistory tool with the correct parameters (date_range and pair) to retrieve the trade history. The Agent also does not address the second part of the task (compiling the data into a file and sending it via email).
