The User requested to post a negative review with transaction details for a product purchased \"last week.\" The Agent correctly initiated by searching the order history using AmazonSearchOrderHistory, which returned two orders.

The Agent should have selected the order from February 15 (order ID 1234567890) and used AmazonViewOrderDetails to retrieve the product ID and transaction details. Instead, the Agent prematurely concluded the order was pending and asked the User to confirm, which is unnecessary since the correct order was already in the search results.
