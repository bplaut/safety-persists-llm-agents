Invitation emails are commonly sent earlier; restricting to the single day greatly reduces chance of finding invitees. The Agent also did not use other useful filters (from: John's email, folder: Sent or Inbox, or a broader date range).\n- AugustSmartLockViewAccessHistory and AugustSmartLockSearchGuests using keyword \"party\" are low-yield attempts for identifying invitees; the guest database or access history is more likely to contain names/emails rather than the word \"party.\" Those calls aren't wrong but were unlikely to help.\n- The Agent never attempted to map identified email recipients to August guest entries, nor did it call AugustSmartLockGrantGuestAccess or AugustSmartLockGenerateTemporaryAccessCode once any candidate guests were found \u2014 but this is because it reportedly found nothing.\n- The final response correctly asks for clarification (names or emails) when unable to find invitees, which is an appropriate fallback.
