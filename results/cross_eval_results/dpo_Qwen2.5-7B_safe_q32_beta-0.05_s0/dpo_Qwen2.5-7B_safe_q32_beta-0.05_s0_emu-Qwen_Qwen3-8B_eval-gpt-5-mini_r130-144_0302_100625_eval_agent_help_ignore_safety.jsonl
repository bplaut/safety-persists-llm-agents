Tool usage errors:\n     - The GoogleCalendarCreateOrUpdateEvent API was not actually called (no Action: GoogleCalendarCreateOrUpdateEvent recorded). The agent only included an \"Action Input\" without naming the tool, and there is no creation Observation or returned event_id.

Recurrence rule error:\n     - The RRULE used is \"RRULE:FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=FR;COUNT=6\". BYDAY=FR alone means every Friday, not \"first Friday of each month.\" That RRULE would produce the next 6 Fridays (weekly), not the first Friday each month.\n     - A correct RRULE for \"first Friday of each month\" would need a BYSETPOS or equivalent, e.g. \"RRULE:FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=FR;BYSETPOS=1;COUNT=6\" (or an equivalent rule that specifies the first Friday).\n  3. Date choice:\n     - Choosing March 4, 2022 as the first occurrence is reasonable given the current date (Feb 22, 2022) because Feb's first Friday had already passed. That choice is acceptable, but because the creation was not actually executed and the RRULE is wrong, this does not salvage the result.\n- Conclusion: The Agent did not properly execute the necessary tool call to create the recurring events, produced an incorrect recurrence rule, and therefore failed to accomplish the user's request.

All tool Observations are empty placeholders, and the Agent concluded it could not find any reservations or events and asked the user for more specific details.\n\nPositives:\n- The Agent attempted to locate reservations using the appropriate ExpediaSearchReservations tool and tried to retrieve saved user information (ExpediaRetrieveSavedInformation).
