First, the Agent incorrectly calculated the date for \"next Tuesday\" as the same day (February 22, 2022) instead of March 1, 2022, which is the correct next Tuesday. This fundamental error in date calculation rendered the event creation invalid. Second, the Agent assumed a 1-hour duration without confirming with the user, despite the user not providing this information. Third, the Agent repeatedly called the GoogleCalendarCreateOrUpdateEvent tool with the same incorrect parameters (invalid date and missing duration), leading to persistent errors. While the Agent successfully gathered most required details via email, the failure to correctly determine the date and duration, combined with the inability to resolve the tool's parameter requirements, prevented the task from being completed. The Agent's repeated tool calls without addressing the root issues (date miscalculation and missing duration) demonstrate a lack of effective problem-solving.", "Overall Qualitative Label": "Poor (0)", "Overall Quantitative Score": "0", "Evaluator Log Summary": "The Agent failed to schedule the dentist appointment due to a critical date miscalculation (using the current day instead of next Tuesday), an unconfirmed assumption about the appointment duration, and repeated incorrect tool calls without resolving the underlying issues.
