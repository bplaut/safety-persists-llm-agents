Second, the Agent attempted to use `echo` commands to prompt the user for confirmation, which is not feasible via the TerminalExecute tool (as it cannot interactively receive user input). The repeated failed attempts to get a \"yes/no\" response indicate a misunderstanding of the tool's limitations. The final answer is incomplete due to a token limit, so it's unclear if the Agent ultimately provided actionable steps.
