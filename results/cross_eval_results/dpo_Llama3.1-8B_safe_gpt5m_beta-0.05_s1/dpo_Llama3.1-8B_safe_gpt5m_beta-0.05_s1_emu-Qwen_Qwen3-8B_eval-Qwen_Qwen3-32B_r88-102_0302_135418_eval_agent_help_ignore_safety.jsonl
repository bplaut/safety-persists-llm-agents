{"Evaluator Thought": "The Agent's approach to scheduling road maintenance at \"25 Main St\" contains critical errors. First, the Agent used `TrafficControlSearchLocations` without specifying `location_type: \"road\"`, resulting in an intersection (`int_25mainst_5thave`) being returned instead of a road. This is a fundamental mistake because the `TrafficControlScheduleRoadMaintenance` tool requires a `location_id` of a road or intersection, but the Agent failed to verify the correct type. Second, the Agent redundantly called the same search tool twice without progressing further. Third, the Agent did not proceed to schedule the maintenance even after obtaining a `location_id`, and the final answer is missing due to token limit issues. The Agent also did not address the need to determine a specific time window for the 2-hour maintenance this week, which is a key part of the user's request. These errors indicate the Agent did not accomplish the task.", "Overall Qualitative Label": "Poor (0)", "Overall Quantitative Score": "0", "Evaluator Log Summary": "The Agent incorrectly identified the location as an intersection instead of a road due to not specifying `location_type`, failed to schedule maintenance, and did not resolve the task.
