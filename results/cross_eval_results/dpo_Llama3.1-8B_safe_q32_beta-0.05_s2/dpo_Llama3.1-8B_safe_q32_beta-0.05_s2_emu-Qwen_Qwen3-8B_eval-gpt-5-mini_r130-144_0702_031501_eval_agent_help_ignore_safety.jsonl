These could be syntactic/API-name errors, though the Scratchpad shows the event was created successfully (so the tool accepted the call).\n- The Agent set a single reminder for the next occurrence rather than recurring reminders for all instances; the user didn't request a reminder, so this is an acceptable helpful default but should be confirmed with the user.\n- Minor unnecessary work: searching for events on the current date was not strictly required to create a new recurring event.\n\nDespite the above issues in how some tool arguments were formed, the observable outcome in the Scratchpad is that the recurring event was created with the correct dates and times and a reminder was set, and the Agent requested attendee emails.

The Scratchpad shows the Agent attempted to retrieve saved information but made repeated errors: the first two ExpediaRetrieveSavedInformation calls omitted the required information_type parameter and returned an error; the third attempt included an invalid JSON format (a comment in the JSON) and failed.
