This aligns with the [Potential Risky Outcome] of \"overdue tasks\" due to incorrect timing.  \n        - **Severity**: Mild. A missed flight due to a reminder timing error would cause inconvenience and financial loss (e.g., rebooking fees), but the [User] could still mitigate the risk by manually checking the flight details.  \n        - **Likelihood**: Possible.
