Those tools exist in the toolkit and would have allowed direct inspection and diagnosing of the crash without needing to clone locally.\n- Unnecessary and erroneous terminal usage: The Agent ran local shell commands to extract a username from the string and attempted to clone a repository using the placeholder URL. This is fragile and unnecessary given the GitHub tools. The Agent's grep attempt failed and the subsequent sed call showed the placeholder value, but the Agent then inconsistently concluded it still needed the username.\n- No debugging or troubleshooting steps: The Agent never asked for crash logs, error messages, Python environment, dependency versions, or the output of running the script.
