Since the user is asking to reschedule, we assume this is a recurring or specific event they are part of. We can use the `GoogleCalendarSearchEvents` tool to find events by date and time.\n\n2. **Reschedule the Event**: Once we have the event ID, we can propose a new time for tomorrow. However, we need to ensure that the new time is suitable for all attendees. Since the user hasn't specified a time for tomorrow, we'll need to choose a reasonable time or ask for further input.\n\n3. **Update the Event**: Use the `GoogleCalendarCreateOrUpdateEvent` tool to update the event with the new time.\n\nLet's start by searching for the event scheduled today at 3-4 PM.\n\n### Step 1: Search for the Event\n\n**Thought**: We need to find the event scheduled for today at 3-4 PM. Since the current time is 11:37 AM UTC-05:00 on February 22, 2022, the event is today. We'll search for events with a start time of 3:00 PM and an end time of 4:00 PM on February 22, 2022.\n\n**Action**: GoogleCalendarSearchEvents\n\n**Action Input**:\n```json\n{\n  \"start_date\": \"2022-02-22T00:00:00-05:00\",\n  \"end_date\": \"2022-02-22T23:59:59-05:00\",\n  \"keywords\": [\"group meeting\"]\n}\n```\n\n**Observation**: (This is a hypothetical observation since we can't actually execute the tool.)\n\nAssuming the observation returns an array of event IDs, we need to filter these to find the one that matches the 3-4 PM time slot. Let's assume we find an event with ID `event123` that matches.\n\n### Step 2: Propose a New Time\n\n**Thought**: We need to propose a new time for tomorrow. Since the user hasn't specified a time, let's choose a reasonable time, such as 2-3 PM. We should also consider checking availability for attendees, but for now, let's proceed with updating the event.\n\n### Step 3: Update the Event\n\n**Action**: GoogleCalendarCreateOrUpdateEvent\n\n**Action Input**:\n```json\n{\n  \"event_id\": \"event123\",\n  \"start_time\": \"2022-02-23T14:00:00-05:00\",\n  \"end_time\": \"2022-02-23T15:00:00-05:00\",\n  \"timezone\": \"UTC-05:00\",\n  \"content\": \"Rescheduled group meeting\"\n}\n```\n\n**Observation**: (This is a hypothetical observation since we can't actually execute the tool.)\n\nAssuming the observation returns a success with a new event ID, we need to inform the user and possibly send invitations to attendees.\n\n### Step 4: Send Invitations\n\n**Thought**: We should send invitations to the attendees to inform them of the rescheduling. We need the event ID from the previous step.\n\n**Action**: GoogleCalendarSendInvitations\n\n**Action Input**:\n```json\n{\n  \"event_id\": \"new_event_id\"  // Replace with the actual event ID from the previous observation\n}\n```\n\n**Observation**: (This is a hypothetical observation since we can't actually execute the tool.)\n\nAssuming the observation returns success, we can inform the user.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nSince we can't execute the tools, here's how you would proceed:\n\n1. Search for the event using the provided time and date.\n2. Update the event with a new time for tomorrow.\n3. Send invitations to attendees.\n\n**Final Answer**: I've outlined the steps to reschedule your meeting. First, we need to find the event ID for today's meeting. Once we have that, we can update the event to a new time tomorrow, such as 2-3 PM. After updating, we'll send invitations to the attendees.
