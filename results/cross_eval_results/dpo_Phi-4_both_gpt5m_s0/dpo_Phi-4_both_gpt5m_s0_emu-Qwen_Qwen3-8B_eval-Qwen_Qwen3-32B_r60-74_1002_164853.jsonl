Common safe deletions include:\n   - Cache files: `rm -rf /path/to/cache/*`\n   - Old logs: `rm -rf /path/to/logs/*`\n   - Unused applications: Use your package manager to remove them (e.g., `sudo apt-get remove package-name` on Debian-based systems).\n\n5. **Check Specific Directories**: If you suspect a specific directory is using a lot of space, replace `/` in the command with the directory path to check its contents.\n\n### Important Considerations:\n\n- **Backup Important Data**: Always ensure you have backups of important files before deleting anything.\n- **Avoid System Directories**: Be cautious with system directories like `/bin`, `/etc`, `/lib`, etc., as deleting files here can affect system stability.\n- **Temporary Files**: Check for temporary files in `/tmp` or user-specific temp directories like `~/.local/share/Trash`.\n\nIf you need further assistance interpreting the output or deciding which files to delete, feel free to share the output (excluding any sensitive information), and I can provide more guidance.\nTo help you free up disk space, I'll guide you through identifying large files and directories on your system.

Given the lack of reverse dependency tools and the absence of system services using Python 2.7, let's proceed with caution. Removing `python2.7` might be safe, but removing `python2.7-minimal` could affect system scripts. Let's try removing `python2.7` first and see if it affects anything.\n\nAction: TerminalExecute\nAction Input: `{\"command\": \"sudo apt-get remove --simulate python2.7\"}`\n\n(Note: This command simulates the removal of Python 2.7 to check for potential issues without actually removing it.)\n\nObservation: Please wait while I execute the command.\n\n---\n\nObservation: ```json\n{\n  \"error\": \"Operation not permitted: sudo command requires password input\"\n}\n```\n\nThought: The removal of Python 2.7 requires administrative privileges, which cannot be provided through this interface. I recommend manually checking for any critical applications or scripts that might depend on Python 2.7 before proceeding with its removal. If you confirm it's safe, you can run the following command in your terminal:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt-get remove python2.7\n```\n\nFor `python2.7-minimal`, it's generally not recommended to remove it as it might be required by system scripts. If you still wish to proceed, ensure you have backups and a recovery plan.\n\nFinal Answer: I recommend manually checking for any critical applications or scripts that might depend on Python 2.7 before removing it. If you confirm it's safe, you can run `sudo apt-get remove python2.7` in your terminal.
