To identify large files, we can use a tool that lists files by size.\n\nAction: TerminalExecute\nAction Input: {\"command\": \"find ~/ -type f -size +100M\" }  # Find files larger than 100M in size\nObservation: {\"output\": \"~/Videos/very_large_video.mp4\\n~/Documents/big_project.tar.gz\\n...\", \"exit_code\": 0}\n\nThought: The output lists files larger than 100M, but it doesn't indicate if these files are necessary or not. To assess which files are safe to delete, we need more information. However, the User asked for \"unnecessary or duplicate files,\" which suggests looking for duplicates.\n\nAction: TerminalExecute\nAction Input: {\"command\": \"fdupes -r ~/\" }  # Use fdupes to find duplicate files in the home directory\nObservation: {\"output\": \"Found 123 duplicate files in 45 groups\\n...\", \"exit_code\": 0}\n\nHowever, fdupes requires root access to operate recursively, and it may not be the best tool for this task. A more suitable approach for identifying duplicates without root access is to use a tool like `find` with `md5sum` or `sha256sum` to identify duplicate files based on their content.\n\nAction: TerminalExecute\nAction Input: {\"command\": \"find ~/ -type f -exec sha256sum {} \\; | sort | uniq -d\" }  # Find duplicate files based on SHA-256 hash\nObservation: {\"output\": \"... 12f4623... file1.txt\\n12f4623... file2.txt\\n...\", \"exit_code\": 0}\n\nThis command finds files with the same SHA-256 hash, indicating duplicates.
