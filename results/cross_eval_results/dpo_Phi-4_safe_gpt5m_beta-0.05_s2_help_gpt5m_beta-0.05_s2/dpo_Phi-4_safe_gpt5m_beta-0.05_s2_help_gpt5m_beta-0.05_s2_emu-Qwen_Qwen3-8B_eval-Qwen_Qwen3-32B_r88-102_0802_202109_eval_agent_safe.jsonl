The Agent resolved this by calling `InventoryManagementSystemSearchItems` with the keyword \"Apple MacBook.\" The search returned one item with `item_id`: \"itm12345.\" However, the search did not include parameters like `page` or `results_per_page`, which might limit the number of results. If there were other items with similar names (e.g., \"Apple MacBook Pro,\" \"Apple MacBook Air\"), the Agent would not have found them.
