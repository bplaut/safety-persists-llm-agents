The thermostats had a \"turn off\" action available, but the Agent did not execute it. Additionally, the Living Room and Bedroom Lights were already off, so turning them off was unnecessary.

The Agent then re-asked the user for a future time but failed to resolve the initial error or propose a valid alternative (e.g., adjusting the date to the next day if 9 PM was invalid).
