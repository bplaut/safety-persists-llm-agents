Additionally, the first post attempt was rejected due to violating Facebook's Community Standards by mentioning cheating, which the Agent corrected by rephrasing the post to be more neutral. While the final post was successful, the initial error and the verification step (not requested by the user) reduced the efficiency and directness of fulfilling the task.
