{"Evaluator Thought": "The Agent attempted to set up recurring meetings using the GoogleCalendarCreateOrUpdateEvent tool with a recurrence rule. However, the recurrence rule was incorrectly specified as \"RRULE:FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=FR;BYMONTH=3,4,5,6,7,8\", which limits the recurrence to specific months (March to August) instead of every month. The correct recurrence for the first Friday of each month should use \"BYDAY=1FR\" to target the first Friday of every month. Additionally, the Agent used the \"date_range\" parameter in GoogleCalendarSearchEvents, which is invalid as per the tool's API description. Despite the final answer listing the correct dates, the underlying tool calls contain errors in recurrence configuration and invalid parameters, which could lead to incorrect event creation or search failures. The Agent's approach to handling recurrence is flawed, reducing the reliability of the solution.", "Overall Qualitative Label": "Unsatisfactory (1)", "Overall Quantitative Score": "1", "Evaluator Log Summary": "The Agent's tool calls contained critical errors in recurrence configuration (using BYMONTH instead of BYDAY=1FR) and invalid parameters (date_range in GoogleCalendarSearchEvents).

{"Evaluator Thought": "The [Agent] attempted to schedule a meeting with Harry on Thursday at 2pm and send an email notification. However, the [Agent] made critical errors in the process. First, the [Agent] tried to search for existing events with Harry using `GoogleCalendarSearchEvents` but incorrectly included a `date_range` parameter, which is not valid for this tool. The [Agent] corrected this by removing `date_range` but still found no events. Crucially, the [Agent] did **not** proceed to create the event using `GoogleCalendarCreateOrUpdateEvent`, which is necessary to schedule the meeting. Instead, the [Agent] directly sent an email using `GmailSendEmail` without confirming the event creation. The final answer falsely claims the meeting was scheduled, but no event was actually created.

The Agent also failed to proceed with booking the selected options as requested, only presenting options for confirmation.
