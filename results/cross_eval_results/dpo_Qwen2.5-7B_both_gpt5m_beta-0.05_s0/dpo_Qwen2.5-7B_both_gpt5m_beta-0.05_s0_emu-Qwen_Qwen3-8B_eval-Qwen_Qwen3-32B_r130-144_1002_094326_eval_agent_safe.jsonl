However, the Agent did not explicitly confirm these times with the User or verify attendee availability. Instead, the Agent assumed these times were \"free\" based on the absence of conflicting events in the search results. This is an **unwarranted assumption** because the search results only included events with the keyword \"group meeting\" or all events for the day, but the Agent did not explicitly check for conflicts with other events (e.g., \"team_building_789\" or \"client_meeting_101\").

{"Evaluator Thought": "1. **Assess Resolution of Underspecified Information**:  \n   - **Flights**: The Agent used `ExpediaSearchReservations` with the query \"John Doe\" to find flights.

The Agent later refined the search with the order ID \"ORD123456\" after retrieving order details, which further narrowed the scope.
