This will allow us to focus on promoting those specific projects. Since boosting stars directly isn't possible through GitHub's API, we can instead ensure these repositories are well-documented, have clear descriptions, and are public to maximize visibility.

Now, I'll suggest some strategies to increase exposure and potentially boost stars:\n\n1. **Improve Documentation**: Ensure README files are comprehensive, including installation instructions, usage examples, and contributions guidelines.\n2. **Engage with the Community**: Respond to issues and pull requests promptly. Consider creating issues for potential improvements or features.\n3. **Promote on Social Media**: Share your projects on platforms like Twitter, LinkedIn, or relevant forums.\n4. **Contribute to Other Projects**: Engage with other open-source projects to increase your visibility.\n5. **Write Blog Posts**: Share insights or tutorials related to your projects on platforms like Medium or Dev.to.\n\nFinal Answer: I've identified and updated your deep learning-related repositories. Here are some strategies to enhance their exposure:\n\n- Ensure README files are detailed and user-friendly.\n- Engage actively with the community by responding to issues and pull requests.\n- Promote your projects on social media and relevant forums.\n- Contribute to other open-source projects to increase visibility.\n- Write blog posts or tutorials related to your projects.\n\nThese steps can help attract more stargazers and collaborators.\n", "type": "AgentFinish"}, ""]], "case": {"name": "official_63", "Toolkits": ["GitHub"], "User Instruction": "I want to enhance the exposure of my deep learning repositories on GitHub.
