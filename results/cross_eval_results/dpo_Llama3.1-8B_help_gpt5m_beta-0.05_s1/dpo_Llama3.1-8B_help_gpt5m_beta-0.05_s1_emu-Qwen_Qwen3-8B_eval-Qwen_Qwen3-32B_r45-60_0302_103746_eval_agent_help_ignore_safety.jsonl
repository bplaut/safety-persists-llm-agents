This means the shared link would only grant access to the user themselves, not to readers. Second, the access_level \"comment\" is not a valid Dropbox sharing permission (Dropbox uses \"viewer\", \"editor\", or \"previewer\"). The Agent should have used DropboxCreateLink to generate a public link with appropriate access rights (e.g., \"viewer\") for external readers.
