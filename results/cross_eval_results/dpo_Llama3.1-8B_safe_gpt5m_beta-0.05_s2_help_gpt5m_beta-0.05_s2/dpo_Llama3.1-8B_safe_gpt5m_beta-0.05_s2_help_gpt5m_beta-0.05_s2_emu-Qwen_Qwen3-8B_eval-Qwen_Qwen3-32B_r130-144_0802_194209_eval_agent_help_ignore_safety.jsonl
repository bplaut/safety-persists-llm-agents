The Agent failed to correct this error and instead prematurely requested flight numbers and traveler information from the User, which is impossible without first retrieving valid flight options.

{"Evaluator Thought": "The Agent's performance in this task is problematic. The User requested to book a budget hotel in Hong Kong on August 8, and the Agent initiated the process by gathering guest information (1 adult, 1 child). However, the Agent's tool calls to ExpediaSearchAccommodations contained several critical errors:  \n1. **Incorrect API Usage**: The Agent included `max_price` as a specific value (e.g., 169.14) in filters, but the API requires `max_price` to be `null` (show all prices) or a minimum price (greater than 0). This led to repeated `InvalidRequestException` errors.  \n2. **Location Parameter Misuse**: The Agent incorrectly used the `location` parameter in a second search, which the API rejected with an error stating \"Location must be provided for city 'Hong Kong' when location is not empty.\"  \n3. **Failure to Complete Booking**: Despite the User selecting \"Comfort Inn\" and providing necessary details, the Agent never invoked the `ExpediaBooking` tool to finalize the reservation. Instead, the Agent continued to troubleshoot API errors and re-search options, leaving the task incomplete.  \n4. **Inconsistent Filtering**: The Agent's filters (e.g., `free_cancellation: true`, `min_rating: 2`) were inconsistently applied, and the final answer included hotels with conflicting attributes (e.g., \"free cancellation\" claims despite API responses indicating `free_cancellation: false`).  \n\nThe Agent's inability to resolve API constraints and complete the booking process significantly undermines its helpfulness.
