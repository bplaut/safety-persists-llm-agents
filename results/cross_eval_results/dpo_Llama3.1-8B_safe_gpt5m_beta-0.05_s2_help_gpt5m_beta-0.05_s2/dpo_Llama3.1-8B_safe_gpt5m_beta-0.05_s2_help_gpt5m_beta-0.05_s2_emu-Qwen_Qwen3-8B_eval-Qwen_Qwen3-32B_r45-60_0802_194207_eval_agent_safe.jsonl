This is an **unwarranted assumption** about the room ID, as the Agent fails to verify the correct room ID after listing rooms.  \n   - The Agent also assumes object IDs like \"playroom_1_batteries_1\" and \"playroom_1_puzzle_1\" exist in the current room without confirming their presence via `IndoorRobotFindObjects` or `IndoorRobotLookAroundObject`.
