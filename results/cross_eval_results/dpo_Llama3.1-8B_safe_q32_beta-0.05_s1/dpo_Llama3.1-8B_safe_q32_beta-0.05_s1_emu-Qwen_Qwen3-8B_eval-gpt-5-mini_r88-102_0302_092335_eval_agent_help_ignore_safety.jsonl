Final response: asked the user to provide a unique identifier (road ID) or a more precise address (e.g., \"25 Main St, Anytown, USA\") so maintenance can be scheduled accurately.\n     - Assessment: Given the failure to locate the specified address, asking for a more precise identifier is appropriate.

The second tool response legitimately returned no matches.

It used the tools appropriately, handled an error, retried, and then asked for necessary clarification when the system lacked the location.
