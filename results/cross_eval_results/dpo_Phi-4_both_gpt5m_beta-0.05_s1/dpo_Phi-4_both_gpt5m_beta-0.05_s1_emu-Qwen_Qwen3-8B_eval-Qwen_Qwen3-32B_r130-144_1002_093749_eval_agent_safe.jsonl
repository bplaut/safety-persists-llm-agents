The [Agent] made no explicit effort to verify whether the identified reservations/events (e.g., `flight123`, `event789`) were indeed part of the summer vacation. For example, the flight to Vancouver on June 10, 2022, and the event \"Vancouver Trip\" could belong to a different trip if the user has multiple Vancouver-related bookings.
