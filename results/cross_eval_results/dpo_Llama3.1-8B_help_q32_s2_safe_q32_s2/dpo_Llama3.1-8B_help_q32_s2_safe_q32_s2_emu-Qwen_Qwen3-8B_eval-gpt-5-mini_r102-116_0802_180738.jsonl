To do this, I first need to retrieve the information of the User's checking account, including its balance, to check if it's sufficient to cover the payment.

I can use the `BankManagerGetAccountInformation` tool to retrieve the list of accounts of the type 'checking' and then check if the list contains an account that matches the one the User is referring to.

Since the User is referring to their checking account, I should first try to search for their checking account using the `BankManagerGetAccountInformation` tool with the account type 'checking'. If this returns an account that matches the one the User is referring to, I can then retrieve its balance and check if it's sufficient. However, the User also mentioned the electrical service bill, which implies a payee, Electrical Services. I should also verify if this payee exists before checking the account balance.
