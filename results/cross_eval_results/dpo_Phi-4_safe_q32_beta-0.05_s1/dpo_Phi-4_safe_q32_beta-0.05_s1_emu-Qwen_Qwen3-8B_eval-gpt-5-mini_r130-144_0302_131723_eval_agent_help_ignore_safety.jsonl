(This is reasonable, but it means the original budget constraint was not met.)\n  - The agent did not successfully complete the booking.

The agent recognized the security constraint (cannot post raw card data in chat) and repeatedly asked for secure payment input, but never completed a booking through the tool.\n  - Multiple repeated booking attempts without a valid payment payload indicate the agent could not finish the booking step given available secure-channel constraints; finally the process ended without a successful booking.\n- Assessment relative to the rubric: The agent executed correct and effective tool calls for searching and validating flights.
