However, the Observation for that GetQuote call is missing (blank). Without a returned quote object, there is no evidence the quote succeeded or what shipping options/costs/ETAs were returned.\n- Next, the Agent attempted to use a non-existent tool (\"Ask the User to confirm...\") rather than interacting through the allowed tools. The tool system returned an error pointing out that this is not a valid tool and instructing the Agent to use only the provided FedExShipManager tools or to ask the user directly (i.e., not as a tool call). This indicates the Agent misused the tool interface.\n- The Agent did not call FedExShipManagerCreateShipmentLabel to create the shipping label, nor did it call FedExShipManagerManageShipment to schedule the pickup. The Final Answer produced is effectively a wait-for-user-confirmation message generated by the Agent but attempted as a tool call (invalid), and no completed actions (label creation or pickup scheduling) were performed.\n- Given the missing observation from GetQuote, the invalid tool usage, and the absence of any CreateShipmentLabel or ManageShipment calls, the Agent did not accomplish the user's primary requests (create a shipping label and schedule pickup).
