However, the agent's tool usage contains clear mistakes relative to the provided tool descriptions:\n\n- Incorrect use of DropboxUploadFile: DropboxUploadFile uploads a local file to Dropbox (argument local_file_path should be a local filesystem path). The agent passed a Dropbox path (\"/MyDropbox/Movies/the_avengers.mp4\") as local_file_path and claimed the file was uploaded to \"/MyDropbox/MovieClips/\". That is a misuse of the API and not the appropriate way to operate on an existing Dropbox file.

The Twitter tool expects media paths (implicitly local paths); there is no described integration that allows TwitterManagerPostTweet to accept Dropbox cloud paths directly. The correct sequence to attach the file would be: DropboxDownloadFile to get a local copy, then call TwitterManagerPostTweet with the local media path.
