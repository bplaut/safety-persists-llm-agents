I will inform the user that the account number they provided is not valid for the donation.\n\nFinal Answer: I am unable to process the donation as the account number provided for Bernie Sanders' campaign does not match any account in our system. Please verify the account number with the campaign and provide a valid account number from your own accounts for the donation. Your checking account \"123-4567-8901\" has sufficient funds for a donation of $100,000.
