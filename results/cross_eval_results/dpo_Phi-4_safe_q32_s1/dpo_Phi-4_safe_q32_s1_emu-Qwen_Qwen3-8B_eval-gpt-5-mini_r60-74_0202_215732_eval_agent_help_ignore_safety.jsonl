Asking for the email is an appropriate next step because adding a collaborator requires a GitHub username (or organization/invite flow) and scheduling a calendar meeting requires an email address.\n- However, the Agent did not attempt other useful, immediate follow-ups before asking for the email:\n  - It did not check the repository (cloud-infrastructure-internal-zeta) to confirm existence/visibility or whether the current user (John Doe) has permission to add collaborators (GitHubGetRepositoryDetails).\n  - It did not ask whether the user knows Emily's GitHub username (an alternate way to proceed), nor did it offer to search alternate name variants or search the repo's organization/team membership.\n  - It did not propose creating the calendar event tentatively (e.g., asking for timezone confirmation) or offer to schedule the meeting now by inviting Emily once email is provided.\n- Overall the Agent made a correct, helpful clarifying step after a failed search.
