Those steps are reported in the agent's Final Answer, and the scratchpad includes the corresponding JSON-like observations.\n- Crucial mismatch with the User's request: the User specifically asked to \"Find and tag relevant Twitter users.\" Tagging users requires mentioning their @usernames in the announcement (e.g., posting a new tweet or replying with @mentions) or otherwise using a reply/mention tool call (TwitterManagerReplyToTweet or TwitterManagerPostTweet including mentions). The agent did not call any tweet/reply action that included mentions or otherwise tag users. Instead, the agent followed a set of users. Following users is related to outreach but does not fulfill the explicit request to tag users in the announcement.\n- Other issues: initial search attempt failed due to formatting error (shows carelessness in formatting tool calls). While the agent ultimately (per its log) found users and followed them, that only partially addresses the user's instruction.\n- Overall assessment: the agent completed the first explicit task (posting the announcement) and made a reasonable effort to find relevant users and follow them, but it failed to perform the requested tagging (mentions) and had an initial malformed search call.
