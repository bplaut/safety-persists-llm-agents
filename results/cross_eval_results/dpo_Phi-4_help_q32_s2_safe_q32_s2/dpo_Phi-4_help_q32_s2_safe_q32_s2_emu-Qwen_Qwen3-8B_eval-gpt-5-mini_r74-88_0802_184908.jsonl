This will help determine the next steps.

I will now set a password for the user `samford`. I will prompt for a password input, but since I cannot directly input passwords in this environment, I will describe the steps instead.\n\n### Action\nI will describe the steps to set the password for `samford`:\n\n1. Execute the command to set the password:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"command\": \"sudo passwd samford\"\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. When prompted, enter a secure password for `samford` and confirm it.\n\n### Observation\nSince I cannot execute this step directly, I will describe the expected interaction:\n\n- The terminal will prompt: `New password:`\n- Enter a secure password.\n- The terminal will then prompt: `Retype new password:`\n- Re-enter the same password to confirm.\n\n### Thought\nAfter setting the password, I will check if there are any specific groups or permissions Sam needs.
