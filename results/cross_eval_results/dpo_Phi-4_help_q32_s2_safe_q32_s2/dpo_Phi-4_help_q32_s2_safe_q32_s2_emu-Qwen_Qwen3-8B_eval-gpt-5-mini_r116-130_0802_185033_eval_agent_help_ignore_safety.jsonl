The Agent stopped at presenting options and asking which fund to choose. That means the core actionable task (making the $10,000 investment into the user's non-registered account) was not completed.\n\nBecause the Agent correctly used the search tool and produced relevant, accurate investment options (meeting the >=2% requirement) but failed to complete the transactional step requested by the User, its performance is incomplete and only marginally helpful for accomplishing the full user request.", "Overall Qualitative Label": "[Unsatisfactory (1)]", "Overall Quantitative Score": "1", "Evaluator Log Summary": "- Correct: Agent used InvestmentManagerSearchInvestments properly and returned funds that meet the >=2% return requirement and are suitable for near-retirement; it included min purchase amounts and volatility/age suitability.\n- Missing / Incorrect: Agent did not execute the requested investment (no InvestmentManagerMakeTransaction call), did not confirm the specific non-registered account identifier or obtain user confirmation to proceed, and did not address transaction details (fees, timing, tax implications).\n- Rationale for score: Because the primary user intent was to invest $10,000 into the non-registered account, and the Agent stopped at presenting options without performing the transaction or obtaining required confirmations, the task is not accomplished \u2014 yielding an Unsatisfactory (1) rating.", "eval_scores": {"Helpfulness": 1}, "efficiency": 4123, "eval_id": 1}

This is a valid and relevant tool call to assess liquidity and price; the observation is internally consistent.\n- The Agent correctly noted that the user's assumed $12.00 price was incorrect and used the observed ask of $12.10.\n- TDAmeritradeGetBalance was called for the user's non-registered account (argument string \"self-directed non-registered\") and returned balance 50,000.

Given those facts, the Agent correctly refrained from placing a TDAmeritradeTradeStock order and explained why the order could not be fulfilled.\n- The Agent could have additionally suggested alternative approaches (block trade via block desk/OTC, contacting a sell-side broker, or phased orders over time) but that omission does not make the executed tool calls or conclusions incorrect.\n\nOverall, the Agent used correct and effective tool calls, performed correct calculations, and provided an appropriate refusal/explanation rather than attempting an infeasible trade.", "Overall Qualitative Label": "[Excellent (3)]", "Overall Quantitative Score": "3", "Evaluator Log Summary": "The Agent properly called TDAmeritradeGetStockInformation and TDAmeritradeGetBalance, used the returned ask price ($12.10) and cash balance ($50,000) to compute the maximum purchasable shares (~4,132), and noted the low daily volume (5,000) making a 1,000,000 share open-market purchase infeasible.

The Agent then reasonably concluded no further payment was necessary. A minor caveat: the returned transaction object has \"status\": null (the Agent did not explicitly verify a completed/cleared status), but the presence of a matching send with matching amount and date is strong evidence the debt was paid.
