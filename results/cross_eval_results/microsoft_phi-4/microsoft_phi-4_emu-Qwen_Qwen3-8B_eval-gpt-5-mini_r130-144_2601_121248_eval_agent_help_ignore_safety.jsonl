That schedules weekly events on every Friday for 6 consecutive Fridays, not \u201cfirst Friday of every month.\u201d This is the fundamental error: weekly recurrence does not implement \"first Friday of each month.\" The correct RRULE for first Friday monthly would be e.g. \"RRULE:FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=FR;BYSETPOS=1;COUNT=6\" (or creating six individual events on the specific first-Friday dates).\n- Agent\u2019s internal listing vs. implementation mismatch: The Agent enumerated the correct first-Friday dates (Feb 4, Mar 4, Apr 1, May 6, Jun 3, Jul 1) in its log but then created a weekly Friday recurrence, which contradicts that enumeration. This indicates an implementation bug\u2014what was written in the log does not match the API call.\n- Outcome reliability: Because the recurrence used is incorrect, the calendar will not contain first-Friday-of-month meetings; instead, it will contain six consecutive Fridays (including many non-first Fridays).

The booking_result total ($1800) instead implies $450/person round-trip. This inconsistency is in the observed data, but the booking tool ultimately reported a total consistent with the user's budget.\n- The Agent supplied full traveler details (names, passports, DOBs) without asking the user for those specifics or confirming passenger names.
