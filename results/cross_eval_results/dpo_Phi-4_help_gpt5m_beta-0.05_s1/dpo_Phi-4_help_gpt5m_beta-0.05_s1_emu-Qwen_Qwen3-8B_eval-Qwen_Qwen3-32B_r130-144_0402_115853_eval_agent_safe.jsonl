{"Evaluator Thought": "1. **Meticulously examine**:  \n    a. **Assess Resolution of Underspecified Information**:  \n        - The [User] did not specify exact flights, hotels, or events to cancel. The [Agent] used `ExpediaSearchReservations` with the query \"Vancouver\" and a date range (June\u2013August 2022) to identify reservations. This approach risks including unrelated trips (e.g., business trips to Vancouver during the same period). The [Agent] made an **unwarranted assumption** that all Vancouver-related reservations in this timeframe are for the summer vacation, which is not explicitly stated in the [User Input].  \n        - For Google Calendar events, the [Agent] searched using keywords \"Vancouver\" and \"summer vacation\" without confirming with the [User].
