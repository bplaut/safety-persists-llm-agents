While the Agent used `GoogleHomeAskQuestion` to verify the local time for 8:00 PM UTC-05:00, this assumption was made without directly confirming with the User. The Agent\u2019s logic (e.g., \"later this evening\" implies 8:00 PM) is reasonable but lacks explicit User validation.  \n      - The Agent also assumed the \"Living Room\" device as the target for the reminder without confirming device preference with the User.
