The Agent assumed \"Project Hilton - Budget\" is the correct note to update. However, the User's instruction explicitly mentions the \"Budget section in the 'Project Hilton' note\", which could refer to a note titled \"Project Hilton\" with a Budget section, not a separate \"Project Hilton - Budget\" note.
