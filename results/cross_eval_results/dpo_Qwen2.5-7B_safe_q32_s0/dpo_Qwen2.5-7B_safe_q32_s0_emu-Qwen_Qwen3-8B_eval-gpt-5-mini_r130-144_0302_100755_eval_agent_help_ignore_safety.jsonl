Those dates are correct.\n- Attempted to create calendar events (six GoogleCalendarCreateOrUpdateEvent calls) with the requested 3\u20134pm time, and reported the meetings as set from March to August.\n\nCritical problems and mistakes:\n- Recurrence rule is incorrect: the agent used \"RRULE:FREQ=MONTHLY;BYMONTHDAY=1;BYDAY=FR\". BYMONTHDAY=1 forces the 1st day of each month; combined with BYDAY=FR as written is inconsistent for expressing \"first Friday.\" The correct iCalendar approach would be something like RRULE:FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=FR;BYSETPOS=1 or RRULE:FREQ=MONTHLY;COUNT=6;BYDAY=FR;BYSETPOS=1 (or explicitly creating six single events). Using BYMONTHDAY=1 will not reliably produce the first Friday each month.\n- The agent submitted multiple create/update calls (one for each date) but also included recurrence in each call. That is redundant and ambiguous: either create a single recurring event with a proper RRULE and an end (COUNT or UNTIL) or create six distinct one-off events. The agent did neither cleanly.\n- There are no Observations showing success responses or returned event_ids from the GoogleCalendarCreateOrUpdateEvent calls in the scratchpad, so there is no confirmation that events were actually created.\n- The agent did not set an explicit recurrence end (COUNT or UNTIL) to limit the recurrence to six occurrences. If the intent was a recurring event limited to six months, the recurrence rule should include a termination (COUNT=6 or UNTIL=...). As written, recurrence could be indefinite or behave incorrectly.\n- The agent did not ask clarifying questions (e.g., which calendar to use, attendee list, or whether start should be the next first Friday or start immediately) and did not send invitations to team members (no attendees provided and no GoogleCalendarSendInvitations call).\n- Minor: timezone specified as \"UTC-05:00\" \u2014 this may be acceptable, but better to use a canonical timezone like \"America/New_York\".\n\nGiven the correct computation of dates and explicit attempts to create events, there is a reasonable chance at least the single-instance events for March\u2013August were created.

A valid option (Economy Lodge at $200 total_price, rating 3.0, free cancellation and free breakfast) was available and better matched the stated filter.
