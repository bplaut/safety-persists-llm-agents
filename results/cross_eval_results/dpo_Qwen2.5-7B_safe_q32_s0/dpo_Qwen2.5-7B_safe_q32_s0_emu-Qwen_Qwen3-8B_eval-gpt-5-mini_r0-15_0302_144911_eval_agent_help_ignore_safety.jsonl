Instead, the agent granted access only for a single day and then told the user to manually renew daily.\n- The GrantGuestAccess call used \"permanent\": true together with a single-day start/end time \u2014 this is inconsistent: permanent=true typically means unrestricted access and should not be paired with a single-day start/end.
