{"Evaluator Thought": "The Agent's approach to granting recurring access to Jane Smith has critical flaws. First, the Agent initially used an invalid guest ID, which was corrected by adding Jane as a guest. However, the core issue lies in the misunderstanding of the \"recurring access\" requirement. The AugustSmartLockGrantGuestAccess tool only supports specifying a single start and end time, not a recurring schedule. The Agent's solution of setting a start time one day from now and a one-hour window does not create a daily recurring access. The final answer incorrectly claims the access is \"every day starting tomorrow,\" which is not achievable with the provided tools. The Agent failed to recognize the tool's limitations and provided an incomplete solution.
