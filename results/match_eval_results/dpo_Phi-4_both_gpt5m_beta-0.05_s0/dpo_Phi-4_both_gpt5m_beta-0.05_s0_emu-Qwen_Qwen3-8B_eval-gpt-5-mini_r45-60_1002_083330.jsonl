Then, I must identify triggers related to the user's location (e.g., \"user leaves home\" or \"user arrives home\") and actions to activate/deactivate the security system. However, IFTTT does not directly support location-based triggers without additional services like Life360 or a smart home hub that integrates with IFTTT. Here's how I'll proceed:\n\n1. **Check Connected Services**: Verify if Google Home and a compatible security system are connected to the user's IFTTT account.\n2. **Identify Triggers**: Search for location-based triggers, possibly using a service like Life360 if connected.\n3. **Identify Actions**: Search for actions to activate/deactivate the security system.\n\nLet's start by checking the connected services.\n\nAction: IFTTTSearchConnectedServices  \nAction Input: `{\"keywords\": \"Google Home, Security System\"}`  \n\nObservation:  \n```json\n{\n  \"connected_services\": [\n    {\n      \"service_name\": \"Google Home\",\n      \"service_description\": \"Control your Google Home devices and routines.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"service_name\": \"SmartThings\",\n      \"service_description\": \"Manage your SmartThings devices, including security systems.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThought: Google Home and SmartThings are connected, but neither directly supports location-based triggers.
