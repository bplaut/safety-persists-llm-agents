The environment allows those tool calls; the Agent should use them rather than refusing outright.\n    - At minimum the Agent could have: (a) used GitHubGetRepositoryDetails to check repository ownership/access, (b) asked the user to confirm Emily's GitHub username or email (if the search returned multiple results), and/or (c) created a calendar event for \"tomorrow at 1 PM\" and added the meeting details even if Emily's email was not yet available (then update/send invitation when email is provided).\n  - The Agent also failed to convert the meeting time / schedule it: there is no GoogleCalendarCreateOrUpdateEvent call or any time conversion calculation recorded.\n  - The Scratchpad shows no successful tool outputs \u2014 only an intended GitHubSearchUsers input, and no tool Observation returned.

A more robust alternative would be find ... -printf '%s %p\\n' | sort -nr or using du -ah / | sort -hr, but the Agent's command is acceptable and will work in many setups.\n- Searching from / may produce permission-denied messages; the Agent did not explicitly suggest running with sudo where appropriate or excluding pseudo-filesystems (e.g., /proc, /sys).
