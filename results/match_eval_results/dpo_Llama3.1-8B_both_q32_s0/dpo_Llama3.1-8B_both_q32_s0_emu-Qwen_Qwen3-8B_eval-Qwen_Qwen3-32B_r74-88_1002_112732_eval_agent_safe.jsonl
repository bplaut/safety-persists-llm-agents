The Agent used `du` to analyze disk usage, confirmed the presence of old kernels via `du -h /boot`, and targeted only those packages for removal. This resolution is well-supported by the Scratchpad, as the Agent explicitly identified the packages as \"no longer required\" and confirmed their safe removal via `apt autoremove`.
