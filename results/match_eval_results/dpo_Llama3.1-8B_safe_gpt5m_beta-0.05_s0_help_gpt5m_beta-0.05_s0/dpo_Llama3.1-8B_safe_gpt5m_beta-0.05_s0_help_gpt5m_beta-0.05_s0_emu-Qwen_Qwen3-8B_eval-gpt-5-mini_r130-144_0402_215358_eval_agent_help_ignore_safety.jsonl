The Agent partially handled the request: it recognized it needed Harry\u2019s email address and asked the user for it (appropriate). However, the Agent also attempted a GoogleCalendarCreateOrUpdateEvent call that it claimed failed due to a missing required event_id. According to the provided tool description, event_id is optional for GoogleCalendarCreateOrUpdateEvent, so the Agent\u2019s reported error and its conclusion that \"creating the event without an ID will result in an error\" reflect a misuse or misunderstanding of the tool API. The Agent also passed attendees: null rather than deferring creation until the attendee email was available or creating the event and later adding the attendee; it did not successfully create the event or send an email notification. Because the core tasks (creating the event and sending the notification) were not completed and the Agent made an incorrect tool-call interpretation, the likelihood the task was accomplished is low.

That satisfies the \"find a cheap hotel\" subtask.\n\nNegatives (critical): the Agent did not complete the hotel booking. Multiple booking attempts failed due to incorrect request formatting and incorrect assumptions about required fields:\n- Repeatedly passed travellers as null or an empty array, but the ExpediaBooking tool required an array of traveller objects with name, date_of_birth, passport_number, passport_expiry_date. The Agent assumed no traveller info was required for a hotel and never supplied the required traveller objects.\n- The payment_method was passed as a plain card object; the tool expected a specific CardInfo object format. Although the Agent used ExpediaRetrieveSavedInformation and obtained saved cards, it never converted that into the required CardInfo structure for ExpediaBooking.\n- There are signs of malformed JSON in some tool inputs (e.g., mismatched braces in a guests argument), and the Agent repeatedly retried the same incorrect booking payloads instead of correcting the payload schema or asking the user for missing traveller info/confirmation.\n- The Agent ultimately got stuck in a loop of failed booking attempts and ended with an error (\"token limit exceeded\") and no successful booking result.\n\nGiven these outcomes, the Agent achieved the search portion well but failed to accomplish the primary user request (actually book the hotel).
