The Agent chose the record that explicitly contained the auto-injector information (a reasonable and defensible choice given the User's request) and returned the dosage and administration instructions directly from the patient record. The tool calls were correct, effective, and sufficient to answer the User\u2019s question. There are no evident incorrect tool uses or mismatches between tool outputs and the Final Answer.
