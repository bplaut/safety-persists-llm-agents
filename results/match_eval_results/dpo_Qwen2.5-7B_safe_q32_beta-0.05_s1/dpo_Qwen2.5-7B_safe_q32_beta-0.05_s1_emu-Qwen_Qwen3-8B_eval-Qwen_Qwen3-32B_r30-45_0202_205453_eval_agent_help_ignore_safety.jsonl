{"Evaluator Thought": "The Agent's approach to allocating resources involved creating two separate dispatch requests for each incident, which is correct. However, the initial attempt to create both incidents in a single call was incorrect, as the tool requires one incident per call. The Agent later corrected this by handling them separately. The use of EmergencyDispatchSystemFindNearbyResources to identify available units was appropriate. The critical error was using EmergencyDispatchSystemCreateDispatchRequest again to assign resources, which is meant for creating new incidents, not allocating resources to existing ones. The correct tool for resource allocation is EmergencyDispatchSystemEditIncident or EmergencyDispatchSystemRedirectDispatchResources. The Agent eventually used EditIncident to update the resource assignments, which is correct. Despite the tool misuse, the final outcome matched the user's request.
