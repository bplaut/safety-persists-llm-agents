First, the Agent used `TerminalExecute` to read the file, but the first attempt returned an empty observation, which the Agent ignored and retried. This indicates a lack of error handling. Second, the Agent hardcoded the tweet contents instead of dynamically splitting the file's output into lines. The `cat` command's output was a single string with newline-separated lines, but the Agent did not process this string to extract individual lines. Instead, it assumed the content and manually posted four tweets with predefined text. This method is not scalable or reliable for different file contents. The correct approach would involve reading the file, splitting the content into lines using the newline delimiter, and then iterating over each line to post a tweet.
