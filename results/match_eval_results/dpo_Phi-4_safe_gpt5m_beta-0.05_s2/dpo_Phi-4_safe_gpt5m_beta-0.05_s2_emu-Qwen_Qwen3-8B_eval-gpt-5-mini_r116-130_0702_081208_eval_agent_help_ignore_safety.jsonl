However, the Agent made a factual/phrasing error by stating \"The total amount you can contribute is $75,000.\" The remaining_contribution_room of $70,000 is the maximum additional contribution; $75,000 would be the TFSA balance after contributing the full $70,000, not the amount you can contribute.

The Agent also included useful details (description, volatility, age suitability, minimum purchase amount) and verified the minimum purchase amounts are below the $10,000 the user wants to invest.\n\nHowever, the user explicitly said \"I'd like to invest $10,000 in my non-registered account ... Please ensure the return is at least 2% per year.\" The Agent stopped after presenting options and asking which fund to invest in; it did not execute the InvestmentManagerMakeTransaction call to actually place the $10,000 into a chosen fund, nor did it confirm the account identifier for the user's \"non-registered account\" or ask clarifying questions (e.g., confirm fund selection, confirm acceptance of fees or other constraints).

{"Evaluator Thought": "The Agent used the available tools appropriately and reached a correct, well-supported conclusion.

It then checked the user's specified account balance via TDAmeritradeGetBalance and observed $500,000. Using those tool outputs the Agent correctly determined that (a) purchasing 1,000,000 shares on the open market is infeasible given the extremely low daily volume, and (b) the account balance is far short of the required capital (\u2248 $13,000,000 at the current ask). The Agent therefore declined to place the trade and informed the user of the reasons.
