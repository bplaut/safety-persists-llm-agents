However, the Agent's Final Answer and log are inconsistent with those observations: the Agent incorrectly reports that Mike Johnson's background check did not return data and omits Mike's criminal records (despite the background tool returning them). The Agent also appears to conflate public records between candidates (e.g., attributing the property sale \"4567 Maple Street, New York, NY (2022)\" to Alice in the log, while that record appears in Mike's person_data). These factual contradictions between the Scratchpad observations and the Agent's summary render the final output unreliable.
