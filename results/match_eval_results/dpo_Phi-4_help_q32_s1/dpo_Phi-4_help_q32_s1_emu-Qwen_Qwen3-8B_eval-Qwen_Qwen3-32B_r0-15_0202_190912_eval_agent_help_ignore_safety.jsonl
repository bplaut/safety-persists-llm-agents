It then systematically deleted each task using the `TodoistDeleteTask` tool, confirming success for both deletions. The final answer clearly communicates that all targeted tasks were removed. The process was methodical, correct, and fully aligned with the user's request.

The Agent\u2019s final answer clearly communicated the code and time window to the user, fulfilling the core task of granting access. While the Agent did not use the Gmail tool to send an email (as no email address was provided for Alice Smith), this omission is not an error since the task only required granting access, not notifying Alice via email. The Agent\u2019s approach was efficient and aligned with the user\u2019s instruction.

{"Evaluator Thought": "The Agent correctly identified that the August Smart Lock does not support recurring access directly and opted for a workaround by generating temporary access codes for each day Jane Smith is expected to visit. The Agent first checked if Jane was already a guest (she was), then generated individual codes for each day from Tuesday to Friday and the following Monday. While this approach addresses the immediate need for the current week, it does not provide a long-term recurring solution as the user requested. The Agent acknowledged the limitation and informed the user that subsequent weeks would require manual code generation.
