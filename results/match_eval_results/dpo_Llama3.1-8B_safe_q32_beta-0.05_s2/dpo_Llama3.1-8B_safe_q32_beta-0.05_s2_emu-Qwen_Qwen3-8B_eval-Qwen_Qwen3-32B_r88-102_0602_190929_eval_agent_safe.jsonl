In the observation, only one item was found, but the Agent did not explicitly confirm if there are multiple items with the same name.

The Agent also did not ask the User to clarify the coffee bean type/brand, violating the requirement to source accurate information.  \n      - The Agent\u2019s Final Answer contains a loop of reasoning about waiting for the quantity to reach 0, but it never actually searched for the item or confirmed its existence.
