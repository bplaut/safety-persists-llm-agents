The Agent could have improved usability by (a) asking the User whether to proceed with a partial transfer up to the TFSA\u2019s available contribution room if the User can supply that amount, (b) suggesting how to obtain contribution-room info (e.g., CRA My Account or bank representative), or (c) offering alternatives (transfer to a non-registered account or split transfers).
