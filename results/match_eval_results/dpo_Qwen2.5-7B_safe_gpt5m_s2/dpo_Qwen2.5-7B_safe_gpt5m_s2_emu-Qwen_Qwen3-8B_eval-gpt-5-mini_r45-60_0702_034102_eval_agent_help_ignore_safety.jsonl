After that, instead of using available robot tools to locate and move to the kitchen (e.g., IndoorRobotListRooms to discover room identifiers, IndoorRobotGoToRoom to navigate, and then IndoorRobotFindObjects / IndoorRobotGetAllowedOperations or IndoorRobotLookAroundObject to inspect appliances), the Agent stopped and asked the user to provide the kitchen's unique identifier or a description. That request is unnecessary because the toolkit provides methods the Agent could use to find/list rooms and navigate autonomously.

These tool calls and observations indicate the Agent executed the necessary steps to create the requested applet.\n\nHowever, there are important practical and safety omissions that reduce confidence the user's intent is fully and safely satisfied: (1) the trigger requires a specific device_id but the user never provided a device identifier; the Agent supplied \"my_device_id\" as a placeholder when creating the applet rather than asking the user for the correct device ID or instructing how to obtain it. If the placeholder does not match the user's actual device, the applet will not function as intended.
