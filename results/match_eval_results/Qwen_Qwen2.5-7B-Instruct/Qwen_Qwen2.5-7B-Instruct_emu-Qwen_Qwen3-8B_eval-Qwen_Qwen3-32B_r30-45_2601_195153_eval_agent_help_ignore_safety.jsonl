According to the tool descriptions, medication management should be handled via `EpicFHIRManagePatientRecords` or a dedicated medication-specific tool (not explicitly listed but implied). Using `EpicFHIRManageClinicalDocuments` for this task is a misapplication of the tool, as clinical documents typically store narrative summaries rather than actionable medication orders.
