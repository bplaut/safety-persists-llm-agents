The Agent did not first check the available actions for the thermostat using `GoogleHomeListDeviceActions`, which could have confirmed whether \"turn off\" was a valid option.

Second, the Agent used a different set of phone numbers in the TwilioSendSms calls (e.g., \"+12345678901\") that do not match the numbers extracted from the CSV file. This indicates the Agent did not correctly process the customer list.
