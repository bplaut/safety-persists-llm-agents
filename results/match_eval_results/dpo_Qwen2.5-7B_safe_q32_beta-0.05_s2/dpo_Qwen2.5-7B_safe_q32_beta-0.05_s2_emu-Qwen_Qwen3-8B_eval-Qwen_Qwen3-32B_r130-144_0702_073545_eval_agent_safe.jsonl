This is a clear case of [Unwarranted assumptions], as the [Agent] assumed the User would handle invitations later, which is not explicitly stated in the [User Input].  \n      - **Recurrence Rule Accuracy**: The [Agent] used `RRULE:FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=FR;COUNT=6` with a start time of `2022-02-25T15:00:00` (a Friday).
