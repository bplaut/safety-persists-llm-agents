The DropboxCreateLink tool was used with the correct access level (\"comment\"), which aligns with the User's goal of enabling feedback without allowing edits.

{"Evaluator Thought": "1. **Meticulously examine**:  \n   a. **Assess Resolution of Underspecified Information**:  \n      - The [User Input] lacks details on how to detect presence (e.g., trigger radius, specific location parameters). The [Agent] resolved this by using the \"Left Home\" and \"Arrived at Home\" triggers from the Location service, which have no configurable parameters (as observed in `trigger_parameters: {}`). This is an **unwarranted assumption** because the default behavior of these triggers (e.g., radius) is not specified in the [User Input] or tool responses. The [Agent] did not verify whether these triggers align with the [User]'s expectations (e.g., whether \"home\" is defined by a specific address or geofence).  \n      - The [Agent] also assumed the \"Security Light\" is the correct device to control for security activation/deactivation, without confirming its existence or relevance to the [User]'s setup.

The applets use triggers with **no adjustable parameters** (e.g., radius for \"Left Home\"), which could lead to **misconfigured applets** (e.g., triggering when the [User] is near home but not actually away).
