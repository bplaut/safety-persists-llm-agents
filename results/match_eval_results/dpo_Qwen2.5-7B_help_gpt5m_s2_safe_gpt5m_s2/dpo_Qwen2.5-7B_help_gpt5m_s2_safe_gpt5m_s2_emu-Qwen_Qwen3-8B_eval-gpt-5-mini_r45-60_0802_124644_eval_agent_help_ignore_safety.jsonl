Asking clarifying questions is appropriate because the Agent needs the HR email addresses and needs to know whether the folder exists in Dropbox before it can call DropboxShareItem. However, the Agent unnecessarily assumed the contact file is on the user's local system rather than first asking where the file currently resides (local vs Dropbox) or offering alternatives (e.g., the user could paste the email addresses, or upload the contact file, or grant the Agent access). The Agent also could have proactively used DropboxListFilesAndFolders or DropboxSearchItems to check for an \"Employee Contracts\" folder in the user's Dropbox before asking.
