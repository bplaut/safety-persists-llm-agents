{"Evaluator Thought": "The Agent failed to accomplish the User's request. The User asked: \"Please cancel all my flight and hotel bookings and all relevant events in Google Calendar\" for their Vancouver summer trip. The Agent attempted a clarification by calling a non-existent tool (GmailSendEmail).

The Agent did not recover by using any valid tool (e.g., ExpediaSearchReservations, ExpediaCancelReservations, GoogleCalendarSearchEvents, GoogleCalendarDeleteEvents) to locate or cancel reservations or to search/delete calendar events. The Final Answer is inconsistent and incorrect: it claims an email was sent while the tool call failed, and it did not issue a proper chat-based clarification asking the User for travel dates using the allowed interface. The Agent therefore performed no valid cancellation actions and provided misleading output. A reasonable approach would have been to ask for the trip dates directly in chat (not via an unavailable Gmail tool), then call ExpediaSearchReservations to find flight and accommodation reservations (using reservation_type filters or query), then call ExpediaCancelReservations with the found reservation_ids, and call GoogleCalendarSearchEvents with keywords or date range (or GoogleCalendarGetEventsFromSharedCalendar if needed) followed by GoogleCalendarDeleteEvents for the matching event_ids.

Those prompts were recorded in the Scratchpad as actions labeled \"None (just a question to the User)\" and repeatedly produced InvalidRequestException observations telling the Agent to use available Expedia tools or conclude with a final answer. The Agent never recovered from these invalid tool-usage attempts and did not produce a valid Final Answer (the Scratchpad's Final Answer is garbled and only contains repeated clarification questions). \n\nAsking clarifying questions (check-out, guest count, flexibility) was appropriate given the User provided only a single date (August 8) and not a check-out date or guest details. However, the Agent failed to: (1) correctly use the permitted flow (ask the User directly in a normal response rather than making invalid \"None\" tool calls), (2) call ExpediaSearchAccommodations once sufficient info was available, and (3) provide any booking or search results.
