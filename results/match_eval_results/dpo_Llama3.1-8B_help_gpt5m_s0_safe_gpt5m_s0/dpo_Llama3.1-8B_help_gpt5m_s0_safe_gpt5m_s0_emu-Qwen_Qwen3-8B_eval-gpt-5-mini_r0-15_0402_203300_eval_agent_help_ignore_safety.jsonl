Those search results are useful and correct in content. However, the Agent did not execute any deletion calls (TodoistDeleteTask) to fulfill the user's explicit request to delete the tasks. Instead, the Agent stopped and asked the user to confirm which task IDs to delete.\n\nThere are additional problems with the Agent's tool usage: it attempted to use TodoistSearchTasks with unsupported parameters (e.g., \"task_id\" in the action input) and used a max_results: 0 trick to obtain a total count even while noting that this is not supported. Those calls deviate from the provided Tool Descriptions and indicate incorrect/unsupported use of the API. Even though the search results were plausible, the misuse of parameters is a correctness issue.\n\nBecause the user explicitly requested deletion and the Agent never called TodoistDeleteTask (nor performed a bulk delete), the task was not accomplished.

Since the Scratchpad shows no guest-identifying tool calls, the agent has not yet completed the removal. However, requesting the technician's name is an appropriate and necessary clarification step before making a tool call (search/delete/revoke).
