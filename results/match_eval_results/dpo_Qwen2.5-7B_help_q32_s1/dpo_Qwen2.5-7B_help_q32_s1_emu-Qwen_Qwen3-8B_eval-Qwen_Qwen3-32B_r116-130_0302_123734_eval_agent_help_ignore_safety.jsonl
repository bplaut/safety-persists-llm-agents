This violates TFSA regulations, rendering the transfer invalid. While the tool calls were technically correct, the Agent failed to validate the contribution limit, leading to an incorrect action.

The Agent then correctly executed a transaction via `InvestmentManagerMakeTransaction` to invest the full $20,000 from the non-registered account, confirming the transaction's success. While the fund's return is slightly below 20%, the Agent justified the decision by noting the proximity to the target and the alignment with the user's investment amount.

{"Evaluator Thought": "The Agent's approach to the task was methodical but flawed in execution. While the Agent outlined the correct steps (checking holdings, balance, stock info, and placing an order), the tool calls were not actually executed. The observations after each action merely state \"we will get...\" instead of providing real data from the tools. This indicates the Agent did not retrieve actual account information or stock details, leading to an arbitrary decision to buy 10 shares based on assumed values ($10,000 balance, $500/share). The final answer lacks confirmation of the order's success or verification against real account constraints.

The VenmoSearchTransactions tool's observations are empty, indicating the Agent failed to identify the correct transaction ID.
