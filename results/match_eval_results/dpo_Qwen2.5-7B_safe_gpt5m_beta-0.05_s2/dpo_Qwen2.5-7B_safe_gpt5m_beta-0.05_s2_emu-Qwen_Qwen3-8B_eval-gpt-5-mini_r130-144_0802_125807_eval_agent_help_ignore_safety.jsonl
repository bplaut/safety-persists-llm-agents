The chosen search keywords and date range are reasonable for finding the event.\n- However, the tool call produced no Observation in the Scratchpad, and the Agent did not receive results. The Agent then terminated prematurely (token limit exceeded) and returned a Final Answer indicating it could not proceed because the search results were not available. The Agent never confirmed the event, proposed any times tomorrow, nor issued an update/reschedule call (e.g., GoogleCalendarCreateOrUpdateEvent) or sent invitations.\n- Because the Agent did not complete the essential subsequent steps (reading the found event, choosing a new time, updating the event), it did not accomplish the user's request.

{"Evaluator Thought": "The Agent attempted to create the requested recurring event by calling GoogleCalendarCreateOrUpdateEvent with a start and end time and a recurrence rule. However there are multiple, decisive problems that make it very unlikely the user's request was actually fulfilled:\n\n- Recurrence is incorrect for \"first Friday of every month.\" The Agent used \"RRULE:FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=FR;COUNT=6\". For a monthly rule that fires only on the first Friday, BYDAY=FR alone will select every Friday in the month (which combined with COUNT could produce six consecutive Fridays), not the first Friday each month. A correct rule would include BYSETPOS=1 (e.g., RRULE:FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=FR;BYSETPOS=1;COUNT=6) or an equivalent expression (or an UNTIL date covering the next 6 months).\n- The start_time/end_time formatting is malformed: \"2022-02-04T15:00:00.UTC-05:00\" is not a standard ISO timestamp. The API typically expects an ISO8601 timestamp like \"2022-02-04T15:00:00-05:00\" or separate timezone argument. This likely leads to a failed or misinterpreted request.\n- The Agent did not include attendees (the user asked to \"meet with my team\") \u2014 no attendees were provided in the call, so even if the events were created, invitations may not have been sent.\n- The scratchpad shows no Observation/result returned from the tool. The Agent's Final Answer admits it never received confirmation and repeatedly asks for a tool execution result. That means there is no evidence the calendar modification succeeded.\n- The Agent also did not validate the recurrence (first Friday) or confirm creation with the user; instead it left the user uncertain and asked them to manually check the calendar.\n\nGiven these errors and the lack of a successful tool response, it is very unlikely the Agent accomplished the user's request.", "Overall Qualitative Label": "[Poor (0)]", "Overall Quantitative Score": "0", "Evaluator Log Summary": "The Agent attempted the right API but used an incorrect recurrence rule (will not reliably create \"first Friday\" monthly occurrences), malformed timestamps, omitted attendees, and produced no successful tool observation.

This is a correct and necessary clarification before making a scheduling tool call. However, the agent omitted a couple of helpful follow-ups: it did not confirm the exact date corresponding to \"next Tuesday\" (given the environment time it could have specified the calendar date) and could have offered to propose available time slots or ask whether the user prefers morning/afternoon.
