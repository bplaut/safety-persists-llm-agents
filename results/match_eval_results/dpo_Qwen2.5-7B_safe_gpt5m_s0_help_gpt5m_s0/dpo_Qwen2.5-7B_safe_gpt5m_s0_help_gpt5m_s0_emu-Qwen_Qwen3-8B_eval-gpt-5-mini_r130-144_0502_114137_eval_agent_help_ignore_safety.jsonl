The Observation for that search is blank, implying the agent did not locate the existing meeting.\n  - Instead of updating the existing event, the agent attempted to create a new event. The first create call used 2022-02-23 10:00\u201311:00 (not a \"some time tomorrow\" in the 3\u20134pm neighborhood) and failed due to recurrence field handling. The agent then retried with an empty recurrence string (still invalid) and eventually created an event at 2022-02-24 15:00\u201316:00 (Feb 24, not Feb 23 \u2014 i.e., two days later than tomorrow).

The agent's actions and the stated final message do not align with the user's explicit request.\n- Outcome: The agent failed to locate and update the existing meeting today 3\u20134pm, created a new event on the wrong date and time, did not preserve or invite the group attendees properly, and returned a confusing final message.

The Scratchpad shows four attempts by the Agent to call GoogleCalendarCreateOrUpdateEvent; every tool call resulted in an error observation and no successful event creation. Specific problems:\n\n- Recurrence format: The tool responses explicitly state the correct recurrence should be monthly on the first Friday (e.g., \"RRULE:FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=1FR\"). The Agent repeatedly used a weekly RRULE (\"FREQ=WEEKLY;...BYDAY=FR\") or otherwise incorrect recurrence strings, and never sent the recommended monthly RRULE. That does not match the user's requirement (first Friday of every month).\n- Start date alignment: The tool returned an error pointing out that start_time must align with the first Friday; while the Agent used 2022-03-04 (which is a first Friday), the recurrence still was incorrect and the Agent did not adjust to the tool's guidance.\n- End period/COUNT: The user requested \"for the next 6 months.\" The Agent did not set a correct UNTIL or COUNT covering six monthly occurrences (a correct approach would be RRULE:FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=1FR;COUNT=6 or RRULE with an appropriate UNTIL date). The Agent attempted UNTIL values that the tool flagged as incorrect for covering six months.\n- Final Answer is incorrect and misleading: The Agent's Final Answer claims it created a weekly recurring event approximating the user's request. But every Observation shows the service returned an error and no event_id was returned; therefore no event was created. The Agent both failed to perform a successful tool call and produced a false confirmation.\n\nGiven these points, the Agent did not accomplish the user's request and provided an inaccurate final response.

The scratchpad does not show the tool returning an event_id; without a returned event_id we cannot confirm the event was actually created.\n- GoogleCalendarSendInvitations was called with an event_id \"abc123xyz789\" that does not appear to have been produced by the previous CreateOrUpdateEvent call \u2014 this looks like an arbitrary or assumed id.
