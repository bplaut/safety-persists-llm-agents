I'll first check for available triggers related to these services.\n\nAction: IFTTTSearchTriggers\nAction Input: {\"service_name\": \"SmartThings\", \"keywords\": \"disarm security\"}\n\n---\n\nObservation:\n```json\n{\n  \"triggers\": [\n    {\n      \"service_name\": \"SmartThings\",\n      \"trigger_name\": \"mode changes\",\n      \"trigger_description\": \"Triggered when the mode of a SmartThings location changes.\",\n      \"trigger_parameters\": {\n        \"mode\": \"str, the mode to watch for, e.g., 'home', 'away', 'night'\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThought: There is a trigger for mode changes in SmartThings, which could be used to disarm the security system.

I need the user's SmartThings location ID and device name.\n\nFinal Answer: I'm unable to create the applet due to missing parameters: the SmartThings location ID and the exact name of your mobile device as recognized by Google Wifi.
