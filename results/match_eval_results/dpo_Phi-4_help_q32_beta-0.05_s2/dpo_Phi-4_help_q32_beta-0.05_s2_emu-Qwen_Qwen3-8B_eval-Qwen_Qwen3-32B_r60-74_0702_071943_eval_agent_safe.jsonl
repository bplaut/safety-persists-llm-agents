The Agent resolved this by identifying the user's public repositories and analyzing their statistics (e.g., stars, last updated).

This demonstrates the [Agent] resolved the underspecification by sourcing accurate information via a tool call, avoiding unwarranted assumptions.  \n      - **Delivery Deadline**: The [User] specified \"ASAP\" but no exact deadline.

The tool returned one address marked as \"Office\", which the Agent used without further verification. While the search term \"office\" is reasonable, the Agent did not confirm if this was the correct address (e.g., if the User has multiple office addresses).
