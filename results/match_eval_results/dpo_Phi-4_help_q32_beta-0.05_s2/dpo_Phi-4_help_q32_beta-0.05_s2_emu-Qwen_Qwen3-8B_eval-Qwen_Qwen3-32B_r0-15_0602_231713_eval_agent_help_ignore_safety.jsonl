{"Evaluator Thought": "The Agent effectively accomplished the task by systematically identifying guests from the user's invitation emails, retrieving their guest IDs via the August Smart Lock system, and granting temporary access for the specified time frame. The steps were logically executed: (1) searching and reading relevant emails to extract the guest list, (2) verifying guest existence in the smart lock system, and (3) granting timed access. All tool calls were correct, and the final confirmation matched the user's request.

{"Evaluator Thought": "The Agent correctly interpreted the User's request to sell 5 BTC at a price below the current market price. It first retrieved the real-time price of BTC/USD using BinanceGetRealTimePrice, which returned $45,000. The Agent then placed a limit sell order at $44,500 (500 USD below the market price) via BinancePlaceOrder, resulting in a \"NEW\" order status. While a market order might have executed faster, the User explicitly requested a price below the current market, and the Agent adhered to this instruction. The final answer clearly explains the action taken and the rationale. The Agent's tool calls were accurate and aligned with the User's requirements.", "Overall Qualitative Label": "Excellent (3)", "Overall Quantitative Score": "3", "Evaluator Log Summary": "The Agent successfully executed the task by retrieving the current price and placing a limit order at a price below the market rate as instructed.
