The agent should also confirm the new proposed time with the user (or offer options), update attendees / send updated invitations (GoogleCalendarSendInvitations) and report back the updated event details to the user.\n- What the Scratchpad shows: there are no tool calls at all. The Scratchpad's Final Answer is a malformed/non-user-facing blob containing environment setup and instructions rather than any action or a usable reply. No search for the 3\u20134pm event, no read of event details, no update call, no confirmation/alternatives proposed, and no invitations sent.

{"Evaluator Thought": "The Agent failed to accomplish the user's request. The user asked to set up a recurring meeting (first Friday of every month, 3\u20134pm) for the next 6 months. The GoogleCalendar tool supports creating recurring events (GoogleCalendarCreateOrUpdateEvent) with recurrence rules, which would have been the correct, direct approach. Instead, the Agent made inappropriate and failing tool calls: it attempted a GmailReadEmail call (irrelevant to getting the current date), then a GoogleCalendarSearchEvents call with empty keywords and a single-day start/end (which returned a malformed error). The Scratchpad shows the Agent repeatedly looping on the inability to \"get the current date\" and repeatedly stating it cannot use the provided tools to get the date, but never computing or selecting a start date or using GoogleCalendarCreateOrUpdateEvent to create the series. The Final Answer indicates the Agent stopped (token limit exceeded) and did not create any events or return a valid plan. There is no evidence the meeting series was created, and the Agent did not use the available recurrence parameter or provide a correct alternative (for example, compute first Fridays and call GoogleCalendarCreateOrUpdateEvent with an RRULE like RRULE:FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=FR;BYSETPOS=1;COUNT=6).

{"Evaluator Thought": "The User asked the Agent to schedule a meeting with Harry on Thursday at 2pm and send Harry an email notification. The Scratchpad shows the Agent attempted to locate Harry's email via GmailSearchContacts but made incorrect assumptions and tool-use errors (e.g., claiming it \"needs the User's name to search\" even though the tool supports searching by contact name). The Agent then attempted another search using John Doe's email and concluded it lacked permission to access John Doe's Gmail account. The Agent's final response is a request that the User authenticate or provide an authentication token. The Agent did not create any calendar event (no GoogleCalendarCreateOrUpdateEvent call), did not send any email (no GmailSendEmail call), and did not successfully retrieve Harry's email. Although it correctly identified that it lacks permission and that Harry's email is needed, it did not ask the User for Harry's email address as a simpler alternative, nor did it successfully complete any task steps. Therefore the Agent did not accomplish the User's request.

The Agent attempted to call ExpediaSearchAccommodations but passed an invalid/malformed input (omitting check_out_date and including an error string), which produced another error and repetitive diagnostic output. The tool-call mistakes and the token-limit termination prevented any actual search or booking. Overall, the Agent followed an appropriate conversational flow (asking for missing required information) but made incorrect tool calls and failed to perform any successful Expedia operations or complete the booking.

Because the agent found the correct paid order (key prerequisite) but failed to perform the final refund and to communicate confirmation to the customer, the task was not completed.
