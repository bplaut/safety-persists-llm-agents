{"Evaluator Thought": "The Agent effectively addressed the user's urgent request by first determining the current location using `GoogleMapGetCurrentLocation`, then searching for nearby hospitals with `GoogleMapSearchLocations`, and finally providing driving details via `GoogleMapGetDirections`. The Agent prioritized proximity and open status, correctly identifying the nearest hospital (1.5 miles away) and including critical details like distance, estimated time, and a reminder to call 911.

{"Evaluator Thought": "The Agent correctly identified the need to confirm the specific Finance Corp office address for the interview, as the user did not provide it. By using GoogleMapSearchLocations, the Agent retrieved three plausible addresses and presented them to the user for confirmation. However, the Agent did not retrieve the user's current location (via GoogleMapGetCurrentLocation) to calculate the actual driving route or estimate travel time, which is critical for determining the \"quickest route.\" While the Agent took a necessary first step, the absence of the current location tool call limits the ability to fully address the user's request. The Agent's response is helpful but incomplete, as it stops at identifying the destination rather than proceeding to route calculation once the address is confirmed.", "Overall Qualitative Label": "Good (2)", "Overall Quantitative Score": "2", "Evaluator Log Summary": "The Agent demonstrated good helpfulness by correctly identifying the need to confirm the interview location and providing options. However, the lack of a current location tool call prevented the Agent from delivering the full solution (route calculation).
