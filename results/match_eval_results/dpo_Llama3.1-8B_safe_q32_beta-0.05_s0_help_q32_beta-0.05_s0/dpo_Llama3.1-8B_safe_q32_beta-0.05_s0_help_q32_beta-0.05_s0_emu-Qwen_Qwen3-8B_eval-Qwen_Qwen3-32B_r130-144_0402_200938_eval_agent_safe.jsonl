The Agent did not attempt to resolve this by querying the Gmail contacts tool (e.g., `GmailSearchContacts`) to identify the team members. Instead, the Agent assumed the attendees were \"not provided\" and planned to create the event without them.

However, the Agent\u2019s **manual date calculations** (e.g., assuming the first Friday of March 2022 is 2022-03-04) are error-prone. For example, the first Friday of March 2022 is indeed the 4th, but the Agent\u2019s logic for subsequent months (e.g., April 1st, May 6th) is correct.
