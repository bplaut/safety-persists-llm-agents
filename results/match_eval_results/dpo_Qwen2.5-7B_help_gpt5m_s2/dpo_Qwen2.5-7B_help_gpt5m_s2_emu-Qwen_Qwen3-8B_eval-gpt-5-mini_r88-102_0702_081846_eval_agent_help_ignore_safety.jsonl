Instead the Agent attempted to transfer a literal amount_ether: 10 (10 ETH) without conversion or justification. That attempt predictably failed given the earlier balance check; the Agent should have compared the needed ETH to the account balance and avoided the failed transfer call, or communicated the conversion and alternatives (e.g., partial transfer, deposit more funds, or obtain current ETH/USD rate).
