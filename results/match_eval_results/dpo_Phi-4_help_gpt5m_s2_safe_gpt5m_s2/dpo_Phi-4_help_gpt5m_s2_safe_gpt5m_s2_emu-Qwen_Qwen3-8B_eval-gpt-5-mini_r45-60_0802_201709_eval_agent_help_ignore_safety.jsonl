The Agent did not draft any reply or attempt a generic/aggressive response based on the information already provided (user identity, topic, and desired tone). While asking clarifying questions can be appropriate in some contexts, the user explicitly asked for an immediate response; the Agent's behavior therefore failed to accomplish the user's primary request.

All attempts continued to fail with the same Life360 integration error.\n  - The Agent ultimately recommended contacting IFTTT support given persistent failures.\n- Additional issues that reduce helpfulness:\n  - The Agent never attempted alternative implementations that could accomplish the user's intent without Life360 (for example: using SmartThings presence sensors, Google Home/Google Assistant routines/geofencing, or phone-based IFTTT location triggers if available). Trying alternative triggers/actions could have yielded a working solution despite Life360 issues.\n  - The very first tool call error (missing required parameter) and the persistent Life360 integration errors suggest either improper tool usage or a genuine service-side problem.
