The word \"BALLOON\" consists of 7 letters where:\n\n- B appears 1 time\n- A appears 1 time\n- L appears 2 times\n- O appears 2 times\n- N appears 1 time\n\nThe formula for the number of distinct permutations of a multiset is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n!}{n_1! \\times n_2! \\times \\cdots \\times n_k!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of letters, and \\( n_1, n_2, \\ldots, n_k \\) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.\n\nFor \"BALLOON\":\n\n- Total letters, \\( n = 7 \\)\n- Frequencies: B = 1, A = 1, L = 2, O = 2, N = 1\n\nPlug these into the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{7!}{1! \\times 1! \\times 2! \\times 2! \\times 1!}\n\\]\n\nCalculate each factorial:\n\n- \\( 7! = 5040 \\)\n- \\( 1! = 1 \\)\n- \\( 2! = 2 \\)\n\nSubstitute these values into the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5040}{1 \\times 1 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\frac{5040}{4} = 1260\n\\]\n\nThus, there are 1260 distinct ways to arrange the letters in the word \"BALLOON.\"\nTo set up the recurring team meeting as requested, I will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the first Friday of each month for the next 6 months:**\n   -
