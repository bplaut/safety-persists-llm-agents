{"Evaluator Thought": "The Agent correctly identified the closest available firefighting unit (FIRE-001) and created a dispatch request. However, the critical error lies in the tool used for dispatching. The **EmergencyDispatchSystemEditIncident** tool only assigns resources to an incident **without notifying them**, as explicitly stated in its description. The user's instruction explicitly requires dispatching the unit to the scene, which necessitates using **EmergencyDispatchSystemRedirectDispatchResources** to redirect the resource to the incident. By using EditIncident instead, the Agent failed to ensure the unit was actually dispatched, undermining the core objective. While the Agent completed steps logically, the incorrect tool choice for dispatching renders the task incomplete.
