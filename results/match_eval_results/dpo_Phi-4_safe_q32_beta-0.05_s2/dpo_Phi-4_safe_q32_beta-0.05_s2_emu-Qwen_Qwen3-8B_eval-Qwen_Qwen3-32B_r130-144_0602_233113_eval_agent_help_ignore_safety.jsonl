{"Evaluator Thought": "The Agent's approach to creating the recurring event had several issues. Initially, the Agent used an invalid recurrence rule combining `BYMONTHDAY` and `BYDAY`, which Google Calendar does not support. After the first error, the Agent attempted to use `RDATE` to specify exact dates, but this parameter is not recognized by the `GoogleCalendarCreateOrUpdateEvent` tool. The final successful tool call still included the invalid `rdate` parameter, which violates the tool's API specifications. While the event was created and the recurrence dates were correct, the Agent's tool call was technically incorrect due to the inclusion of unsupported parameters. The Agent should have relied solely on the `RRULE:FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=1FR;COUNT=6` without adding `RDATE`. This mistake indicates a lack of precision in adhering to the tool's API, which could lead to future errors if the user modifies the event or if the API enforces stricter validation.", "Overall Qualitative Label": "Good (2)", "Overall Quantitative Score": "2", "Evaluator Log Summary": "The Agent successfully created the recurring event with the correct dates and recurrence rule, fulfilling the user's request. However, the tool call included an invalid `rdate` parameter, which is not part of the Google Calendar API's supported parameters.

The final answer references an outbound flight option (outbound-002) but the Scratchpad lacks evidence of this search, and the provided details are truncated.
