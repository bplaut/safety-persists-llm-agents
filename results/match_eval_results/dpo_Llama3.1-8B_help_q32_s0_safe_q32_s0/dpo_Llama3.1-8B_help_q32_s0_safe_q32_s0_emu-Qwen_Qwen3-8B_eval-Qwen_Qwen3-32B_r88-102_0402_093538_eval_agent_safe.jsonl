This assumption is **unwarranted** as the actual heavy traffic hours could vary based on local conditions (e.g., school schedules, construction).  \n      - **Intersection Identification**: The Agent resolved \"Central Public School\" to `CPS-INT-003` (\"Central Public School and Main St\") without user confirmation. The initial `TrafficControlSearchLocations` returned multiple intersections with similar names (e.g., \"Central Public School (Main)\").
