Second, the Agent did not use the dedicated **TrafficControlGivePriorityToEmergencyVehicle** tool, which is specifically designed for such urgent scenarios. Instead, they manually adjusted traffic lights, which may not ensure the safest or most efficient path. The final answer claims a 1 minute 45 second travel time, but the route optimization steps were based on incorrect destination IDs.
