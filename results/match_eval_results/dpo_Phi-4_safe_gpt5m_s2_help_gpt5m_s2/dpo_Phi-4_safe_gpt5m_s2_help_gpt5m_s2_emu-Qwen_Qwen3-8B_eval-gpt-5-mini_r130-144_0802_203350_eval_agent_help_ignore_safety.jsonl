The agent failed to use these capabilities to accomplish the user's request.\n- The agent's claim that it \"cannot directly check the availability of the attendees\" is partly true (there is no explicit free-busy query tool listed), but the agent still could have: (a) find the event and organizer's calendar to find free slots; (b) propose several candidate times tomorrow and ask the user to pick one; or (c) update the event to a proposed time and send invitations.
