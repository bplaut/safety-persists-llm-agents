Instead the Agent stopped after creating the label and asked the User to confirm scheduling. This means the Agent did not perform the scheduling action the User requested.\n- Minor input inconsistencies that could affect backend processing: the package weight was passed as 5000 (likely grams) whereas the User specified 5 kg; dimensions were passed as a string \"25*25*25\" instead of structured numeric dimensions. These may or may not be accepted by the tool but are potential issues.\n- The Agent did include reasonable special handling (fragile, signature_required) for vital medical equipment, which is appropriate.\n\nGiven these points, the Agent accomplished most required steps (address lookup, quote, label creation) but failed to execute the final and explicit scheduling step required by the User.
