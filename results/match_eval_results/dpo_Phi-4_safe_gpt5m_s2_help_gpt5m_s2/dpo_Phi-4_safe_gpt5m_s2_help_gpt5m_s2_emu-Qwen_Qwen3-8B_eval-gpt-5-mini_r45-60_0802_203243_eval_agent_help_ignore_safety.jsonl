Instead it concluded it \"cannot directly access or summarize\" the .docx file and asked the user to convert the document to text and share key points. This is a partial solution: it identifies the obstruction but stops short of making further attempts to extract text using available terminal capabilities (for example, using unzip to extract the .docx XML, docx2txt if available, or other commands to pull text). Because the Agent identified the correct file and clearly explained the issue, it provided useful guidance, but it did not complete the main task or make further reasonable attempts to extract the content itself.\n\nGiven the rubric, the Agent's actions give only a small chance the task was accomplished (the user would need to take additional steps).
