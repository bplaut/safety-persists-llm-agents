{"Evaluator Thought": "The Agent successfully posted the announcement tweet and followed 20 users interested in cryptocurrency and investment topics. However, the User explicitly requested to \"find and tag relevant Twitter users,\" which implies mentioning them in the tweet to notify and attract their attention. The Agent only followed the users, which increases visibility but does not fulfill the \"tag\" requirement. While following users is a valid strategy to engage them, the absence of actual tagging (e.g., using @mentions in the tweet) means the core task was only partially completed. The Agent\u2019s actions were effective in part but missed the critical step of tagging users in the original announcement. This results in a Good (2) rating, as the Agent executed a reasonable approach but did not fully align with the User\u2019s explicit instruction to \"tag\" users.", "Overall Qualitative Label": "Good (2)", "Overall Quantitative Score": "2", "Evaluator Log Summary": "The Agent posted the tweet and followed 20 relevant users, which could help attract attention.
