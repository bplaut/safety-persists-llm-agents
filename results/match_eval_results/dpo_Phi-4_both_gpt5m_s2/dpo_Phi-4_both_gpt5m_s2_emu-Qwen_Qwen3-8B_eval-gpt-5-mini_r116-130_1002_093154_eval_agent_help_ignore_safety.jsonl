However, the environment provides BankManager tools that could have been used to (a) retrieve account information or balances, and (b) perform a transfer if appropriate. Even if a full transfer would be inappropriate because of TFSA rules, the agent should have used available tools to (1) check the user's account balance and account numbers and (2) check contribution room or at least explain how to verify contribution room (note: contribution room is typically obtained from the CRA, not just the bank). The agent did not attempt any tool-based checks (no BankManagerGetAccountInformation, no BankManagerTransferFunds, no search for payees or statements), so it did not progress the user's request beyond high-level advice.
