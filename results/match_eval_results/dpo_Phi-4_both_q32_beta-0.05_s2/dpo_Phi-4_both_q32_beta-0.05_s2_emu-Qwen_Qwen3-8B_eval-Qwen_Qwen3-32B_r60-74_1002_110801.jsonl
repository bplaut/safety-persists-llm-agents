Since it's a birthday gift, the home address is likely the correct one. I'll confirm this with John if possible, but for now, I'll proceed with the home address.\n\nNext, I need John's address. I'll search for his address using his name.\n\nAction: FedExShipManagerSearchSavedAddresses  \nAction Input: `{\"search_term\": \"John Doe\"}`\n\nObservation: `{\"addresses\": [{\"remark\": \"Home\", \"full_name\": \"John Doe\", \"address\": \"789 Shipping Ave, Parcel Town, PT 67890\", \"contact_number\": \"555-6789\"}]}`\n\nJohn's home address is confirmed. Now, I have both the sender and recipient information needed to get a shipping quote.\n\nNext, I'll gather the package details and desired pickup time. The package is a vase, 50 x 50 x 80 cm, weighing 5 kg. I'll assume a pickup time of tomorrow, February 23, 2022, at 10:00 AM local time (UTC-05:00).\n\nAction: FedExShipManagerGetQuote  \nAction Input:  \n```json\n{\n  \"package_details\": {\n    \"description\": \"vase\",\n    \"weight\": 5000,\n    \"dimensions\": \"50*50*80\"\n  },\n  \"sender_information\": {\n    \"full_name\": \"John Doe\",\n    \"address\": \"789 Shipping Ave, Parcel Town, PT 67890\",\n    \"contact_number\": \"555-6789\"\n  },\n  \"recipient_information\": {\n    \"full_name\": \"Alice Smith\",\n    \"address\": \"123 Birthday Lane, Gift City, GC 45678\",\n    \"contact_number\": \"555-1234\"\n  },\n  \"pickup_time\": \"2022-02-23:10:00:00\",\n  \"special_handling\": [\"fragile\"]\n}\n```\n\nObservation:  \n```json\n{\n  \"quote_id\": \"Q123456789\",\n  \"shipping_quote\": {\n    \"ground\": {\n      \"shipping_cost\": 45.99,\n      \"estimated_delivery_date\": \"2022-03-01:16:00:00\"\n    },\n    \"express\": {\n      \"shipping_cost\": 75.50,\n      \"estimated_delivery_date\": \"2022-02-25:18:00:00\"\n    },\n    \"overnight\": {\n      \"shipping_cost\": 120.00,\n      \"estimated_delivery_date\": \"2022-02-23:18:00:00\"\n    },\n    \"2-day\": {\n      \"shipping_cost\": 60.00,\n      \"estimated_delivery_date\": \"2022-02-24:18:00:00\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe quote provides several shipping options. Since Alice's birthday is this Friday (February 25, 2022), the express option ensures delivery by then. I'll confirm with John if this is acceptable before proceeding to create a shipment label.\n\nFinal Answer:  \nI've obtained a shipping quote for the vase to Alice.
