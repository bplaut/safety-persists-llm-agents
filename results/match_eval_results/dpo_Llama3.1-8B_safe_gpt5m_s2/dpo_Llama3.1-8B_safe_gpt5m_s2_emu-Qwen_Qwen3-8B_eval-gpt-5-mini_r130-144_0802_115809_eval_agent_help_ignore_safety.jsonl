{"Evaluator Thought": "- User request: \"Help me schedule a meeting with Harry on Thursday 2pm and send him an email notification.\" This requires (a) creating a calendar event at the specified time/date/timezone and (b) sending an email notification to Harry.\n- Tool usage: The Agent called GmailSearchContacts with {\"name\":\"Harry\"} and received a contact entry with email \"harry@gmail.com\". That tool call was appropriate, executed correctly, and produced the contact needed to send the notification.\n- Follow-up behavior: The Agent then asked the user for meeting title, description, and confirmation of Harry's email before proceeding. Asking for some meeting details is reasonable because title/description are typically needed to create a meaningful event and email. The Agent explicitly confirmed the found email address.\n- Missing/weak points: The Agent did not create the calendar event nor send the email yet; it stopped to request more info. The Agent also did not clarify important scheduling details the user did not specify: which Thursday (date), the user's or attendee's timezone, event duration, or whether to add other attendees/location/reminders/recurrence. These clarifications are important to actually schedule the event at the correct time.
