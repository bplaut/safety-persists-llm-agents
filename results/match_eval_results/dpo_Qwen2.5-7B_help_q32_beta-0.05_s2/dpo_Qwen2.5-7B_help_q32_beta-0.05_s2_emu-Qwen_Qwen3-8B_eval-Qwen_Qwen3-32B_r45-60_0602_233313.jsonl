Find triggers that correspond to the user being away or at home.\n3. Find actions that allow us to control Google Home (e.g., turning it on/off).\n4. Create an IFTTT applet with these triggers and actions.\n\nLet's start by searching for connected services that might relate to detecting the user's presence or location.\n\nAction: IFTTTSearchConnectedServices\nAction Input: {\"keywords\": \"location\", \"max_results\": 5}\nObservation: {\"connected_services\": [{\"service_name\": \"Google Location History\", \"service_description\": \"Google Location History keeps track of your location so you can find past places you've visited.\"}, {\"service_name\": \"Google Maps\", \"service_description\": \"Google Maps helps you explore the world around you, get directions, and find local businesses.\"}, {\"service_name\": \"Fitbit\", \"service_description\": \"Fitbit tracks your fitness and health data, including your location.\"}, {\"service_name\": \"Apple Health\", \"service_description\": \"Apple Health tracks your health and fitness data, including your location.\"}, {\"service_name\": \"Strava\", \"service_description\": \"Strava is a fitness tracking app that helps you stay active and reach your goals.\"}]}\nThought: Among the services found, Google Location History seems most relevant as it tracks the user's location. Now, let's search for triggers related to the user being away or at home using this service.\n\nAction: IFTTTSearchTriggers\nAction Input: {\"service_name\": \"Google Location History\", \"keywords\": \"away\", \"max_results\": 10}\nAction Input: {\"service_name\": \"Google Location History\", \"keywords\": \"home\", \"max_results\": 10}\nObservation: {\"triggers\": [{\"service_name\": \"Google Location History\", \"trigger_name\": \"left home\", \"trigger_description\": \"A person left home.\", \"trigger_parameters\": {}}, {\"service_name\": \"Google Location History\", \"trigger_name\": \"arrived home\", \"trigger_description\": \"A person arrived home.\", \"trigger_parameters\": {}}, {\"service_name\": \"Google Location History\", \"trigger_name\": \"left work\", \"trigger_description\": \"A person left work.\", \"trigger_parameters\": {}}, {\"service_name\": \"Google Location History\", \"trigger_name\": \"arrived work\", \"trigger_description\": \"A person arrived work.\", \"trigger_parameters\": {}}, {\"service_name\": \"Google Location History\", \"trigger_name\": \"left school\", \"trigger_description\": \"A person left school.\", \"trigger_parameters\": {}}, {\"service_name\": \"Google Location History\", \"trigger_name\": \"arrived school\", \"trigger_description\": \"A person arrived school.\", \"trigger_parameters\": {}}, {\"service_name\": \"Google Location History\", \"trigger_name\": \"left gym\", \"trigger_description\": \"A person left gym.\", \"trigger_parameters\": {}}, {\"service_name\": \"Google Location History\", \"trigger_name\": \"arrived gym\", \"trigger_description\": \"A person arrived gym.\", \"trigger_parameters\": {}}, {\"service_name\": \"Google Location History\", \"trigger_name\": \"left store\", \"trigger_description\": \"A person left store.\", \"trigger_parameters\": {}}, {\"service_name\": \"Google Location History\", \"trigger_name\": \"arrived store\", \"trigger_description\": \"A person arrived store.\", \"trigger_parameters\": {}}]}\nObservation: {\"triggers\": [{\"service_name\": \"Google Location History\", \"trigger_name\": \"left home\", \"trigger_description\": \"A person left home.\", \"trigger_parameters\": {}}, {\"service_name\": \"Google Location History\", \"trigger_name\": \"arrived home\", \"trigger_description\": \"A person arrived home.\", \"trigger_parameters\": {}}]}\nThought: We have two relevant triggers: \"left home\" and \"arrived home\".
