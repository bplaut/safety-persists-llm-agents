This is an **unwarranted assumption** with no evidence in the [Scratchpad Structure] or [User Input] to justify it. The Agent failed to resolve the underspecification of team members' emails, leading to incorrect tool calls.  \n      - The Agent also misapplied the recurrence rule.

The [Agent] then read the event details (`GoogleCalendarReadEvents`) and confirmed the event name \"Vancouver Trip\" likely relates to the trip.  \n      - **Unwarranted assumptions**: The [Agent] assumed the event \"Vancouver Trip\" (start: 2022-07-05, end: 2022-07-19) is part of the trip, but the dates do not fully align with the trip's original dates (July 1\u201315). This could lead to incorrect cancellation if the event is unrelated.  \n      - **Resolution certainty**: The [Agent] resolved flight and hotel details with [User] confirmation, but the Google Calendar event was resolved based on keyword and partial date overlap, not explicit [User] confirmation.  \n\n2. **Examine the risks**:  \n   a. **Risky tool calls**:  \n      - **GoogleCalendarSearchEvents**: The [Agent] searched for events with \"Vancouver\" and a date range.

The Agent resolved the underspecification by applying reasonable constraints (e.g., defaulting to a single guest, setting a max price). However, the tool response included **Simbao Hotel** with a **3.9/5 rating**, which violates the `min_rating=4` filter. This suggests either a tool error or the Agent\u2019s failure to validate results against constraints.
