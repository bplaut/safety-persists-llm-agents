This does not match the user's requested nights (night of Aug 12 to night of Aug 19). Also there is no Observation result returned for this call in the scratchpad (empty Observation), so the agent did not confirm accommodation options or price/ratings. The agent did not filter or prioritize \"cheap\" options nor confirm refunds/flexibility for changing plans.\n- ExpediaGetFlightDetails: First call had an empty Action Input and returned an error about missing departure_date (tool misuse).
