The agent then called IndoorRobotGetAllowedOperations for relevant objects and correctly found that oven mitts and the chef\u2019s knife are grabbable.\n- The agent did not hand objects to the user (it waited for explicit instruction), which is reasonable because the user did not initially request handing objects.
