While some non-critical files in the user's home directory were deleted, the root partition remains 95% full, indicating the main issue (e.g., `/var/log`, `/var/tmp`) was not addressed. The Agent's final attempt to analyze `/var` with `du` correctly identified large directories but failed to act on them (e.g., clearing `/var/log` or `/var/tmp`).
