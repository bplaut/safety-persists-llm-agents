The agent also found other appliances (oven, microwave, blender) and received status descriptions for them.\n\nHowever, there are two important issues that reduce confidence in complete correctness:\n- Inconsistency between tool observation and the agent's final message about the oven: the FindObjects observation for the oven states \"The oven is currently on and displaying a red light,\" but the agent's final text claims the oven is \"inside a cabinet and not currently in use.\" That is a factual contradiction and a misreporting of tool output.\n- The agent's Final Answer is presented in a malformed wrapper ([unavailable or non-string: {...}]) in the Scratchpad, indicating a formatting/output error even though the content communicates the result. There was also a redundant initial FindObjects call that returned nothing, but the agent retried and succeeded.\n\nGiven that the critical item (the stove) was found and correctly reported as on with a blue flame, the agent very likely accomplished the primary user goal of checking stove status.
