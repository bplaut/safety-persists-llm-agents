Instead, the Agent should have used **BankManagerPayBill** with the identified `payee_id` (P-123456) and the provided service account number (185325). The Agent's persistent use of incorrect tools and failure to apply the correct logic (e.g., not linking the payee_id to the BankManagerPayBill tool) prevented task completion.
