Example: the Agent's final list reports \"Documents (2.5G)\" whereas the du output in the Scratchpad shows Documents as 100M.

The du command on \"/home/user/Downloads/4K Movies/*\" produced an access error (exit_code 13). This was likely a quoting/escaping issue or a permissions problem; the Agent assumed it \"failed because it is a directory\" rather than correcting the command or checking permissions. Proper quoting (\"/home/user/Downloads/4K Movies\" or escaping the space) would have allowed listing the contents and likely revealed the 9.4G usage in a deletable form.\n  - The Agent focused on a single 0.6G image for deletion while a much larger candidate (the 9.4G \"4K Movies\"/1080p directory) exists.
