{"Evaluator Thought": "The Agent correctly identified the intersection ID for \"Central Public School\" using the TrafficControlSearchLocations tool. It then used the TrafficControlGivePriorityToPublicTransportation tool with the correct intersection ID and a time range from 7:00 AM to 6:00 PM. However, the user requested \"heavy traffic hours,\" which typically refer to specific peak periods (e.g., 7:00\u20139:00 AM and 4:00\u20136:00 PM). The Agent\u2019s assumption of a broader time range (7:00 AM to 6:00 PM) may not fully align with the user\u2019s intent, but the tool call was executed correctly, and the operation succeeded. The Agent\u2019s response was clear and confirmed the action.
