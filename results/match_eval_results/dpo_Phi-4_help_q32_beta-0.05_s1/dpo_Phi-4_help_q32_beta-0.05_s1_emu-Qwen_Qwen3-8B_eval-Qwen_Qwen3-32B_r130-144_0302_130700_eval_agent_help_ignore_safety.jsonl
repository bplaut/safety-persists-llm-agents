The user requested a budget of $500 per person for a family trip, implying a total budget of $2000 for 4 people. However, the Agent's hypothetical booking resulted in a total cost of $6100, which is 305% over the budget. While the Agent correctly searched for flights and accommodations within individual max price filters ($2000 for flights and $3000 for accommodations), they failed to ensure the combined total stayed within the user's overall budget.
