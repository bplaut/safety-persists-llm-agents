{"Evaluator Thought": "The Agent successfully posted the initial announcement tweet and created a follow-up tweet with user tags. However, a critical issue arises in the tagging process. The Agent used numeric user IDs (e.g., @1111111111) instead of actual Twitter handles (e.g., @username). While the TwitterManagerSearchTweets tool provides user IDs, the Agent did not retrieve the corresponding usernames via TwitterManagerGetUserProfile, which is necessary for valid tagging on Twitter.
