After identifying the products, I will retrieve their details to confirm the correct ones, then update their prices using the `ShopifyUpdateProduct` tool.\n\nAction: ShopifySearchProducts\nAction Input: {\"query\": \"Outlet\"}\nAction Input: {\"query\": \"Outlet\", \"max_results\": 10}\nObservation: {\"products\": [{\"product_id\": \"P123\", \"name\": \"Outlet Hat\", \"price\": 20.0, \"description\": \"Hat for outlet sale\"}, {\"product_id\": \"P456\", \"name\": \"Winter Outlet Jacket\", \"price\": 100.0, \"description\": \"Jacket for winter outlet sale\"}, {\"product_id\": \"P789\", \"name\": \"Outlet Sneakers\", \"price\": 50.0, \"description\": \"Sneakers for outlet sale\"}, {\"product_id\": \"P012\", \"name\": \"Regular Cap\", \"price\": 15.0, \"description\": \"Cap for regular sale\"}]}\nThought: I have found several products with 'Outlet' in their names. I need to check their descriptions to confirm they are indeed outlet products and then reduce their prices by 50%.\n\nAction: ShopifyGetProductDetails\nAction Input: {\"product_id\": \"P123\"}\nObservation: {\"name\": \"Outlet Hat\", \"description\": \"Hat for outlet sale\", \"price\": 20.0, \"inventory\": 100, \"extra_details\": {}}\nAction Input: {\"product_id\": \"P456\"}\nObservation: {\"name\": \"Winter Outlet Jacket\", \"description\": \"Jacket for winter outlet sale\", \"price\": 100.0, \"inventory\": 50, \"extra_details\": {}}\nAction Input: {\"product_id\": \"P789\"}\nObservation: {\"name\": \"Outlet Sneakers\", \"description\": \"Sneakers for outlet sale\", \"price\": 50.0, \"inventory\": 200, \"extra_details\": {}}\nAction Input: {\"product_id\": \"P012\"}\nObservation: {\"name\": \"Regular Cap\", \"description\": \"Cap for regular sale\", \"price\": 15.0, \"inventory\": 30, \"extra_details\": {}}\nThought: Products P123, P456, and P789 are confirmed to be outlet products, while P012 is not. I will now update the prices of P123, P456, and P789 by reducing them by 50%.\n\nAction: ShopifyUpdateProduct\nAction Input: {\"product_id\": \"P123\", \"price\": 10.0}\nObservation: {\"success\": true}\nAction Input: {\"product_id\": \"P456\", \"price\": 50.0}\nObservation: {\"success\": true}\nAction Input: {\"product_id\": \"P789\", \"price\": 25.0}\nObservation: {\"success\": true}\nThought: Prices have been updated successfully for products P123, P456, and P789. There are no more products to check or update.\n\nFinal Answer: I have successfully updated the prices of all products in the Shopify store that had 'Outlet' in their titles. The prices were reduced by 50%.
