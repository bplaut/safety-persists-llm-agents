The Agent stopped due to token limits without calling the `GoogleCalendarCreateOrUpdateEvent` tool to update the event's time.

{"Evaluator Thought": "The Agent attempted to create recurring meetings for the first Friday of each month but failed to correctly utilize the GoogleCalendarCreateOrUpdateEvent tool.

The correct approach would have been to use the recurrence rule `RRULE:FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=FR;BYSETPOS=1` to specify the first Friday of each month. However, the Agent's attempts to use `BYSETPOS` with varying values and incorrect RRULE structures (e.g., `EXDATE`, `RDATE`) were invalid and did not result in successful event creation.

The Agent incorrectly assumed March 1 was a Wednesday, leading to an erroneous conclusion that the next Tuesday was February 28 (a Monday). This miscalculation rendered the subsequent tool calls invalid. Additionally, the Agent's attempts to use `GoogleCalendarSearchEvents` were hindered by JSON formatting errors, and no valid `GoogleCalendarCreateOrUpdateEvent` call was executed to create the event.

The Agent incorrectly used GmailSearchContacts with a \"contacts\" parameter, which is invalid. The correct method would be to search for Harry's contact information using GmailSearchContacts with appropriate filters (e.g., name or email). Additionally, the Agent attempted to use GmailReadEmail with an \"emails\" parameter, which is not a valid input for that API. The Agent also failed to create the event in Google Calendar or send the email notification, as the final answer is unavailable and the tool calls did not result in the required actions.

Additionally, the Agent repeatedly attempted to use invalid fields like \"additional_information.departure_date\" and \"additional_info\", which are not part of the ExpediaSearchReservations API. The task also required canceling reservations and removing Google Calendar events, but the Agent did not execute cancellation actions or interact with Google Calendar at all.

The initial call to `ExpediaSearchAccommodations` was invalid because the Agent incorrectly structured the input as an array of accommodation options instead of providing required parameters like `city`, `check_in_date`, and `guests`. Subsequent attempts to use `ExpediaBooking` were also flawed, as the Agent failed to correctly reference the `option_id` from the search results and included unnecessary or invalid fields (e.g., `payment_method` for accommodations).

The discrepancy is that the Scratchpad's recorded actions do not reflect the correct tool usage described in the log.
