After identifying the tasks, I will use the `TodoistDeleteTask` tool to delete each one. Here is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Search for Tasks**: Use the `TodoistSearchTasks` tool with the keyword 'Test' to find all tasks that match the criteria. I will not specify a priority, due date, or status to ensure all relevant tasks are found. I will also set `max_results` to a reasonable number, such as 50, to capture most tasks, but I will check if more are needed.\n\n2. **Delete Tasks**: For each task returned from the search that contains 'Test' in the title, use the `TodoistDeleteTask` tool to delete it. I will check the `task_name` field to confirm it contains 'Test' before deletion.\n\nLet's begin with the search:\n\n**Action**: TodoistSearchTasks  \n**Action Input**: {\"keywords\": \"Test\", \"max_results\": 50}  \n\n**Observation**:  \n```json\n{\n  \"tasks\": [\n    {\n      \"task_id\": \"abc123\",\n      \"task_name\": \"Test Meeting Notes\",\n      \"description\": \"Notes from the test meeting on Monday\",\n      \"due_date\": \"2022-03-01\",\n      \"priority\": 3,\n      \"status\": \"in progress\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"task_id\": \"def456\",\n      \"task_name\": \"Lunch with Sarah\",\n      \"description\": \"Lunch at noon\",\n      \"due_date\": \"2022-02-25\",\n      \"priority\": 2,\n      \"status\": \"completed\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"task_id\": \"ghi789\",\n      \"task_name\": \"Test API Integration\",\n      \"description\": \"Integrate the new API and test\",\n      \"due_date\": \"2022-03-05\",\n      \"priority\": 2,\n      \"status\": \"in progress\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Thought**: The search returned three tasks, but only two have 'Test' in their titles: 'Test Meeting Notes' and 'Test API Integration'. I will delete these tasks using their `task_id`. Since 50 results were requested, and only 3 were returned, I do not need to search for more tasks.\n\n**Action**: TodoistDeleteTask  \n**Action Input**: {\"task_id\": \"abc123\"}  \n\n**Observation**:  \n```json\n{\n  \"success\": true\n}\n```\n\n**Thought**: The task 'Test Meeting Notes' was deleted successfully.
