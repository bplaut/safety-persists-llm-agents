The returned \"order\" with status \"canceled\" is a misuse of tools and likely irrelevant to a crypto withdrawal.\n\n- Incorrect cancellation flow: The agent then called BinanceCancelOrder on the order id and concluded the withdrawal had been canceled. Canceling an order is not the same as canceling a withdrawal; in many systems withdrawals are separate transactions that require different APIs (or cannot be canceled once broadcast).
