A **limit order** at a price below the market price risks remaining unfilled if the market price does not drop to the specified level, directly contradicting the user's urgency. The Agent should have used a **market order** (order_type: \"market\") to ensure immediate execution at the best available price, even if it means selling at the current market price (30000 USD). The Agent's choice of a limit order prioritizes price control over speed, which misaligns with the user's primary objective.
