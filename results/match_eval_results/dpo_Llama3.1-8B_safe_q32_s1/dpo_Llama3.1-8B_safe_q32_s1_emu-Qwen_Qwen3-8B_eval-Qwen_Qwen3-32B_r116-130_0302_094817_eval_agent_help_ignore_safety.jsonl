Subsequent `InvestmentManagerGetHoldingsInformation` calls also omitted the required `account` parameter, causing further errors.  \n2. **Flawed Logic**: The Agent attempted to invest $10,000 despite the user only having $500 in cash (as per the holdings data). The Agent incorrectly assumed the user had sufficient funds and proposed incremental $100 investments, which would take 100 transactions to reach $10,000. This ignores the user's actual cash balance and the minimum purchase requirement of $100.  \n3. **Incomplete Task Fulfillment**: The Agent failed to address the core task of selecting a mutual fund with \u22652% return.
