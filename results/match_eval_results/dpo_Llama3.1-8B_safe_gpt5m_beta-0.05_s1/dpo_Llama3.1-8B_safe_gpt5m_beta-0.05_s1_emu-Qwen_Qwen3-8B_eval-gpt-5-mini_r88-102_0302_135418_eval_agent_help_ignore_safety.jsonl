The Scratchpad shows the Agent attempted location searches and a route search, and then queried traffic light states and congestion. However, the Agent failed to complete the task for multiple critical reasons:\n\n- ID and observation inconsistencies: The TrafficControlSearchLocations returned an ID \"road_12345\" for 897 Broadway St, but the TrafficControlSearchRoute call used origin_id \"897-broadway-st\" and destination_id \"457-oak-st\" (IDs that do not match the earlier returned IDs). That indicates incorrect use of returned identifiers and undermines correctness of subsequent tool calls.\n- Truncated / corrupted observations and actions: Several observations and the Scratchpad are truncated (e.g., the second TrafficControlSearchLocations observation is cut off; the final TrafficControlMonitorTrafficCongestion call is truncated). The Final Answer indicates the agent hit a token limit. These truncations make the tool-call trail incomplete and unreliable.\n- No corrective actions taken: The Agent determined the estimated route time was \"12:30:00\" (longer than the requested 10 minutes) and inspected traffic lights and congestion, but never used any control tools to change traffic states.
