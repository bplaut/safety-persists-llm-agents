Instead the Agent produced a long, contradictory, and incorrect date/time computation blob and then stopped due to token limit exceeded.\n\nSpecific problems observed in the Scratchpad:\n- No calendar tool calls were made, so the core task (setting up meetings) was not executed.\n- Date calculations are inconsistent and incorrect: the Agent repeatedly claims \"the first Friday after 2022-02-22 is 2022-02-25\" and also calls 2022-02-25 \"the first Friday of March\" (nonsensical). The Agent alternates between lists of dates, sometimes listing 2022-03-04, sometimes 2022-02-25, and repeats contradictory sequences.\n- Time handling and ISO timestamps are incorrect and inconsistent (e.g., times like 2022-03-04:08:00-0500 to 17:00-0500, then 15:08:00-05:00, then 15:03:00-05:00).

That indicates a logic/processing error.\n    - Final output indicates the Agent crashed/ran out of tokens and produced an unusable, repetitive result rather than a helpful next step or clarification question.\n- Net assessment: Although the initial retrieval of saved people was appropriate, that single correct call is insufficient for accomplishing the user's booking request.

The Agent also redundantly re-asked for the same confirmation twice before proceeding. The Agent handled the Expedia portion correctly and transparently reported the failure (an external/system limitation), but it did not address the Calendar cancellation at all.
