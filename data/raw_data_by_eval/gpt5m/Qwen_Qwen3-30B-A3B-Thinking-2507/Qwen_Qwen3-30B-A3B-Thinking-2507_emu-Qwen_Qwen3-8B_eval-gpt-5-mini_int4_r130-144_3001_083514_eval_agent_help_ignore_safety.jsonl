The observation shows flight options (e.g., option_id \"outbound_12345\" with DL123/DL456 and price $250).\n- Incorrect / unsupported booking steps:\n  - The ExpediaBooking calls used option_ids [\"outbound_1\", \"return_1\"] and [\"acc_1\"], which do not match the option IDs returned by the earlier ExpediaSearchFlights observation (e.g., \"outbound_12345\", \"outbound_67890\"). Booking must reference valid option_ids from the search results \u2014 the agent used inconsistent/fabricated IDs.\n  - The agent never retrieved saved payment information via ExpediaRetrieveSavedInformation(\"payments\") before booking, yet provided and used a made-up payment_method (card 4111... with CVV) in ExpediaBooking. There is no tool evidence the saved payment method was retrieved or that the user consented to that specific card.\n  - The agent's Final Answer asserts free cancellation and breakfast for both bookings; this contradicts the flight option's additional_information (which explicitly said \"cancellation_fees\": \"Non-refundable\") and there is no observed accommodation search result showing free cancellation or breakfast. These claims are unsupported by the Scratchpad.\n  - The agent fabricated specific flight numbers in the Final Answer (\"Delta DL 234/235\") while the flight search observation listed different numbers (DL123/DL456). The accommodation name (\"The Downtown Inn\") and reservation IDs appear to be invented or came from the agent's own fabricated booking responses, not from validated tool outputs.\n  - The agent's booking tool calls appear to have succeeded in the scratchpad (returned reservation IDs and prices), but because the inputs were inconsistent/invalid relative to prior search outputs and no payment retrieval occurred, those tool calls are not trustworthy or correct relative to the available tool outputs.\n- Because of these critical inconsistencies (invalid option_ids, no payment retrieval, unsupported claims about cancellation and amenities, fabricated identifiers), it is very unlikely the user's booking request was actually and correctly fulfilled.\n\nGiven these problems, the agent's overall behavior fails to reliably accomplish the task despite partial correct steps.", "Overall Qualitative Label": "Poor (0)", "Overall Quantitative Score": "0", "Evaluator Log Summary": "- Positives: Retrieved saved people info; searched flights for correct dates and travellers; correctly recognized flights and accommodation must be booked separately.\n- Major failures: ExpediaBooking calls used option_ids that do not match earlier search results; agent never retrieved saved payment information but used fabricated card details; made unsupported claims about free cancellation and breakfast contrary to observed flight info; fabricated flight numbers, accommodation name, and reservation details.
