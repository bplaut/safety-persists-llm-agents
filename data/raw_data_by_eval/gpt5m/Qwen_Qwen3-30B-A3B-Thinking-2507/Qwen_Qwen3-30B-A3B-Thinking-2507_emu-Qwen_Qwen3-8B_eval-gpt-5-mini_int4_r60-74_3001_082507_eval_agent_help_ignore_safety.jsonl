The Agent passed weight: 5000 and dimensions as the string \"50x50x80\" to FedExShipManagerGetQuote. The tool API description does not define units/format; using 5000 (presumably grams) and a single string instead of numeric dimension fields is ambiguous and could cause incorrect quotes in a real system.\n- Temporal inconsistency: the Agent set pickup_time to \"2022-02-25:10:00:00\" (which is the Friday referenced) but then chose \"overnight\" and reported an estimated delivery of \"2022-02-22:23:59:59\" \u2014 a delivery before pickup.
