The Scratchpad Final Answer even contains a stray log object that looks like parameters for a transaction search, but no tool call was actually made and no observation returned for transactions.

The unsupported claim about no recent payments is a substantive error that could mislead the User.\n\nGiven that the Agent made partial correct progress (checked balance and requested confirmation before sending) but also made an incorrect/unverified assertion about transaction history and omitted the required tool call(s) to verify payments, the overall helpfulness is limited.
