Given the reported balance $2,500,000 and ask price $12.05, the correct maximum shares affordable (ignoring lot-size restrictions) is about 207,468 shares, not 204,166.67. The Agent used 204,166.67, which is incorrect and results in buying fewer shares than possible.\n- The Agent submitted a fractional share quantity (204,166.67). Stock trades require integer share quantities (and in this case the stock has lot size 100), so fractional quantities are invalid or at least unrealistic. The tool outputs also show fractional holdings, which is inconsistent with typical brokerage behavior and indicates the Agent did not enforce integer/lot-size constraints.\n- The Agent ignored the ask_lot_size (100) returned by TDAmeritradeGetStockInformation. Considering ask_lot_size=100, the Agent should have rounded down to the nearest 100-share lot affordable (calculation: floor(2,500,000 / (12.05*100)) = 2,074 lots = 207,400 shares). The Agent\u2019s executed quantity (204,167) is both not a multiple of 100 and smaller than the properly rounded maximum (207,400).\n- The final totals are inconsistent: the Final Answer states 204,167 shares at $12.05 for a total cost of $2,453,999.55.
