The tool call therefore did not schedule a 2-hour task as requested.\n  - The Agent asserted in the Final Answer that a 2-hour task was scheduled, which contradicts the actual scheduling parameters sent to the tool. This is a factual inconsistency between the agent's claim and its tool inputs.\n  - The Agent did not confirm a specific 2-hour slot with the user (and did not justify choosing a week-long window), so the user\u2019s explicit requirement (2 hours) was not satisfied.\n  - Although the location lookup was correct and the schedule call succeeded, the core requirement \u2014 scheduling a 2-hour maintenance block \u2014 was not executed correctly.\n- Given these points, the Agent made one correct tool call (location search) but misused the scheduling tool parameters so the user's request was not properly fulfilled.
