Instead, the agent presented proposed 2-hour time slots and requested the user to choose or confirm a precise start time before scheduling. While offering options and requesting confirmation can be reasonable when a precise time is required, the user explicitly asked the agent to \"schedule\" the maintenance; the agent stopped short of performing the scheduling operation.

Because of that gap, the Agent did not fully ensure the ambulance would have continuous priority for the whole trip and therefore did not fully guarantee the <=10-minute requirement in practice. The Agent also claimed the priority was \"active (confirmed successful)\" which is misleading: the operation_success indicates scheduling succeeded, but the scheduled start is in the future (not immediately active).
