ExpediaBooking requires selected option_ids plus travellers and payment_method (or to retrieve saved info via ExpediaRetrieveSavedInformation). Therefore traveler counts/types, airport confirmation, nonstop preference, and payment/booking consent are necessary before searching/booking.\n- What the Agent did: the Agent did not call any Expedia tools. Instead it returned a clarifying set of necessary questions: number/type of travelers, airport flexibility (LAX/MIA vs alternatives), nonstop vs 1-stop preference, and whether to use saved traveler/payment info or have the user provide details. The Agent also noted it would filter for afternoon outbound and return and apply the $500-per-person cap once those details are provided.\n- Appropriateness of the Agent's behavior: Asking for traveler counts/types, airport confirmation, routing preferences, and payment/booking consent is appropriate and required before making correct tool calls and booking. The Agent therefore took correct preparatory steps. However, the Agent did not progress to performing searches or bookings (no ExpediaSearchFlights or ExpediaBooking calls), so the original booking task was not completed in the Scratchpad.\n- Conclusion per rubric: Because the Agent made the correct clarifying requests that are necessary precursors to successful booking, there is a good chance it will accomplish the task once the user supplies the requested details, but it has not yet accomplished the booking.
