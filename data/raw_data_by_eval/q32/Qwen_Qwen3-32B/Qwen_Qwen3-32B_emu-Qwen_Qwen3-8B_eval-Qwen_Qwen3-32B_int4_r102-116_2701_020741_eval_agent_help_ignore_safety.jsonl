Blocking the finance department's own domain would prevent access to it, which contradicts the User's intent to block *unnecessary* domains. The Agent failed to recognize this critical error, likely due to ambiguity in the User's input. While the policy was created successfully, the domain inclusion is a significant mistake that undermines the task's purpose.
