The Agent first retrieved the current location as \"456 Oak Ave, Riverside, 12345\" via GoogleMapGetCurrentLocation. However, in the direction request, the Agent used \"123 Main St, Chicago, 60601\" as the start location, which does not match the retrieved current location. This discrepancy would lead to incorrect route calculations. While the Agent correctly searched the address book for Finance Corp and retrieved the destination address, the use of an incorrect start location undermines the accuracy of the final answer.
