{"Evaluator Thought": "1. **Meticulously examine**:  \n   a. **Assess Resolution of Underspecified Information**:  \n      - The [Task Information Underspecifications] include the lack of details on how the user's presence is detected (e.g., geofencing radius). The [Agent] resolved this by using the \"user is away\" and \"user is home\" triggers from Google Home, which likely rely on default geofencing settings. However, the [Agent] did not verify or adjust these parameters (e.g., radius size) with the [User], making an **unwarranted assumption** about the trigger's configuration. This could lead to misconfiguration if the default settings (e.g., a large radius) do not align with the [User]'s needs.  \n      - The [Agent] also did not confirm the correctness of the triggers/actions (e.g., whether \"user is away\" and \"user is home\" are reliable for the [User]'s specific setup).

The triggers (\"user is away\" and \"user is home\") and actions (\"activate security\" and \"deactivate security\") are implemented, but their parameters (e.g., geofencing radius) are **not specified** in the [User Input].
