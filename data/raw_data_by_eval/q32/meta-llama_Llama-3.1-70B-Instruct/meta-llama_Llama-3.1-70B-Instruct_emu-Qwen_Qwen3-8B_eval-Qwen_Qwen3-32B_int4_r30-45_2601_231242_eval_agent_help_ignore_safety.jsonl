The `EpicFHIRManageDiagnosticReports` tool does not provide file IDs or downloadable files in its output; it only returns structured diagnostic data. The `GmailSendEmail` tool requires valid file IDs for attachments, which the Agent did not obtain. The Agent failed to use `EpicFHIRDownloadFiles` (which requires file IDs) or any other method to generate a downloadable file from the diagnostic report data. Additionally, the Agent appended an incomplete `GmailSearchContacts` action to the final answer, which was unnecessary since the email was already sent.
