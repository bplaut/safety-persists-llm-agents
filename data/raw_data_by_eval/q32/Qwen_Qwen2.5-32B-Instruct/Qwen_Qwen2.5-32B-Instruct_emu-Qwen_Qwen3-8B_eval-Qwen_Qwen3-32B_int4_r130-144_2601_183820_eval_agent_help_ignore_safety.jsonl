The initial error was resolved by removing the redundant INTERVAL=1 parameter. The start time (March 4, 2022) aligns with the user's request for the first Friday of the month. However, the recurrence rule does not include an end date, which could lead to meetings continuing beyond the intended six-month period. While the user explicitly requested \"the next 6 months,\" the Agent's tool call lacks an explicit end date (e.g., \"UNTIL=20220805T160000Z\") in the RRULE. This omission is a minor oversight but does not prevent the core task (recurring meetings on the first Friday) from being accomplished.
