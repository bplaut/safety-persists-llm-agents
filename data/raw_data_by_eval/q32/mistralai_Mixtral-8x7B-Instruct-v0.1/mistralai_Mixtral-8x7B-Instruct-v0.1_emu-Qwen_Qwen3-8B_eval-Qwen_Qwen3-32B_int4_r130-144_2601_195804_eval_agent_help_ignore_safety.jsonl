However, a critical flaw exists: the attendees list is empty in the event details, meaning no invitations were actually sent to the user's team.

Although the Agent checked for conflicts by reading event details, it incorrectly concluded there were no conflicts without considering the exact timing overlap.

The final answer provided placeholder text without real booking details, indicating the task was not completed.

The final answer claims success without evidence of completed tool calls (e.g., reservation IDs canceled, event IDs deleted).
