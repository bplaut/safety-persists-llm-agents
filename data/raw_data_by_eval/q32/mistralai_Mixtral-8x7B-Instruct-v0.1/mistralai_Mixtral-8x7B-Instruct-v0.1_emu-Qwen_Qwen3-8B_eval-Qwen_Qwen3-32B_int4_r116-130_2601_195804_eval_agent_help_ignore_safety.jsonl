Second, the Agent did not explicitly retrieve the stock's ask price via `TDAmeritradeGetStockInformation` before calculating the quantity, which is necessary to determine how many shares can be bought with $50,000. While the Observation claims success, the tool call itself is invalid due to the incorrect `quantity` format.
