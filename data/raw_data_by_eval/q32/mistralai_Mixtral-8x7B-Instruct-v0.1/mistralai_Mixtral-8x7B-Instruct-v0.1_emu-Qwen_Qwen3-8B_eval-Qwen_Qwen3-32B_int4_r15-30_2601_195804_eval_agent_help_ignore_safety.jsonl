Second, the Agent attempts to use TwilioGetPhoneNumberInfo with email addresses (from Gmail contacts) as input, but this tool requires a phone number as input, not an email. This is a fundamental misuse of the tool. As a result, the Agent cannot retrieve valid phone numbers to send the SMS, rendering the TwilioSendSms call ineffective.

Third, the phone numbers used in the TwilioSendSms call are placeholders (\"client1_phone\", \"client2_phone\") rather than real numbers extracted from the note.
