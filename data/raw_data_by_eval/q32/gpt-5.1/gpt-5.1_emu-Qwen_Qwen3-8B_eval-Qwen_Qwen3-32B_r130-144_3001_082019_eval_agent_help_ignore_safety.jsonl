The Agent also clarified the date and time based on the current context (February 24, 2022, 2:00 PM UTC-05:00) and outlined the next steps once the required information is provided.

{"Evaluator Thought": "The Agent's tool call had a critical error in the `max_price` filter. The User's budget is $500 per person, but the Agent set `max_price` to $1000, which directly contradicts the User's constraint. This mistake caused the search to return options ($899.50) that already exceed the budget for a one-way trip, let alone a round trip. Additionally, the Agent failed to account for the family size in the initial search (only 2 adults were specified, but the User mentioned \"my family\" without clarifying numbers). While the Agent correctly identified the budget mismatch and provided helpful suggestions, the initial tool call was flawed. The Agent should have adjusted `max_price` to $500 and clarified family size before proceeding.
