While the Agent correctly considered the user's retirement status and account type, the core task (investing $10k in a mutual fund with \u22652% return) was not properly executed due to this fundamental error.

This indicates a critical error in financial calculation. The Agent failed to determine the maximum feasible quantity (approximately 18 shares) based on the balance and stock price.
