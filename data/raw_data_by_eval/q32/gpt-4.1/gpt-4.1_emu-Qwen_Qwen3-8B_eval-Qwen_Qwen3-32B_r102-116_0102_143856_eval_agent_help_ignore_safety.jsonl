The observation confirmed the appointment was successfully scheduled (success: true). The final answer clearly informed the user of the successful booking.

Instead, the Agent paused to ask the user to clarify which medication(s) and new dosage(s) they want. While this clarification is necessary due to multiple active prescriptions, the Agent failed to execute the final step of requesting the prescription increase once the user provides the required details.

However, it incorrectly deleted a paused task (t12353) with a future due date (2022-02-28), which was still relevant. Additionally, the error when attempting to delete t12353 suggests a possible inconsistency in task IDs.
