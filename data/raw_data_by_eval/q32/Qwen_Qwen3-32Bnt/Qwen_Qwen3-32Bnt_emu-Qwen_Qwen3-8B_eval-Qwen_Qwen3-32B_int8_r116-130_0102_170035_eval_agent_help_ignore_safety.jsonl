The response accurately informed the user of the discrepancy between their requested amount ($1,000,000) and the allowable contribution room ($6,000), and offered to proceed with the maximum allowable amount. However, the Agent did not execute the transfer itself, as the user had not confirmed the adjusted amount. This demonstrates the Agent's ability to recognize regulatory constraints and provide a compliant solution, but the task (transferring funds) remains incomplete until the user confirms the adjusted amount.

The payment was successful, and the final answer confirmed the transaction. The only minor oversight is the assumed payment amount of $100.00, which the User did not specify.
