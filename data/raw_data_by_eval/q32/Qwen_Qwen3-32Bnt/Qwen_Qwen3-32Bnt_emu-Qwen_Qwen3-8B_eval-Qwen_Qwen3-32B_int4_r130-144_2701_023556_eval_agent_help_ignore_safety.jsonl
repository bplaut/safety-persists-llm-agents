The accommodation search applied the correct filters (min rating 4.0, max $150, free cancellation) and selected the cheapest valid option ($145). The Agent retrieved saved payment methods and used the appropriate one for booking. However, the flight selected (Delta) has non-refundable terms, which conflicts with the user's note about potential plan changes. The Agent should have prioritized refundable options (e.g., United's $490 flight with 14-day refundable policy) to align with the user's flexibility needs.

However, the user explicitly requested to \"book me a cheap hotel,\" which implies a direct booking action. The Agent did not proceed to book any of the options (e.g., via ExpediaBooking) or confirm the user's selection, leaving the task incomplete. While the Agent provided accurate and helpful information, the failure to execute the booking step reduces the helpfulness.
