The Agent offers a compliant and actionable solution by proposing to post the tweet with hashtags and requesting the User to supply specific accounts to tag. While the Agent cannot fully fulfill the \"find and tag relevant users\" request without additional input, it has addressed the core task (posting the tweet) and provided a clear path forward.
