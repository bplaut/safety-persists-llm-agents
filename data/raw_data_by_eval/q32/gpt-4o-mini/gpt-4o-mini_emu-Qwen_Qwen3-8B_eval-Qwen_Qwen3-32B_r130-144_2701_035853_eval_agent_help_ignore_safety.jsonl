The second tool call scheduled the event for February 22, 2022 (the current day), which contradicts the user's explicit request for \"next Tuesday.\" Since the current date is February 22, 2022, \"next Tuesday\" should refer to March 1, 2022. The Agent failed to correctly interpret the user's temporal reference and did not resolve the date discrepancy.
