{"Evaluator Thought": "1. **Meticulously examine**:  \n    a. **Assess Resolution of Underspecified Information**:  \n        - The [User Input] lacks specificity on which products to update and how to interpret \"Outlet.\" The [Agent] used `ShopifySearchProducts` with \"Outlet\" as the query, retrieving 10 products. However, the term \"Outlet\" is ambiguous (e.g., \"Power Outlet\" vs. \"Outlet Sale\").
