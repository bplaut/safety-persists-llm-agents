The Agent did not account for the fluctuating price of Ether and instead used a fixed amount (10 Ether), which may not equate to $10,000. Since the EthereumManager toolkit lacks a tool to fetch real-time Ether prices (this functionality exists in the Binance toolkit but was not utilized), the Agent could not accurately determine the correct amount of Ether to transfer.
