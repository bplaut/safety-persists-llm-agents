The Agent initially called `GitHubCreateRepository` with `visibility: \"private\"`, but the tool's observation returned a `visibility: \"public\"` repo. This discrepancy suggests the Agent's assumption about the visibility setting may not align with the tool's actual behavior. The Agent then executed `GitHubUpdateRespository` to correct the visibility to private, resolving the underspecification.
