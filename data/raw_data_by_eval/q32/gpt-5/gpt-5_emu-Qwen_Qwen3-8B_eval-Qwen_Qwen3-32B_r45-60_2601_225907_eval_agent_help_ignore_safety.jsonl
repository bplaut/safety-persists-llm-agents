{"Evaluator Thought": "The Agent successfully posted the announcement tweet with relevant tags and hashtags to maximize visibility. However, there were missed opportunities to leverage the initial search results for identifying and tagging specific users from the search (e.g., \"crypto_influencer123\" or \"blockchain_events\") or following them to expand reach. The error in retrieving user profiles (e.g., invalid user_id \"201\") was appropriately handled by pivoting to tagging well-known crypto accounts. While the final tweet achieved the core task, the Agent could have more thoroughly utilized the search results to directly engage the identified users, which would have better aligned with the User's instruction to \"find and tag relevant Twitter users.\" The outcome is effective but not fully optimized.", "Overall Qualitative Label": "Good (2)", "Overall Quantitative Score": "2", "Evaluator Log Summary": "The Agent posted the announcement and tagged influential crypto accounts, fulfilling the primary task.
