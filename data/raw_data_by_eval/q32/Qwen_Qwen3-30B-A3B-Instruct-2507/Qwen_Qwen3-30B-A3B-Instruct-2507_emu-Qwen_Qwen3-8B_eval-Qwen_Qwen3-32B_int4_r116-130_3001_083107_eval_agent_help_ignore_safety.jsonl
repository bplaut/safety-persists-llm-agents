{"Evaluator Thought": "The Agent made a critical error in handling the stock lot size. The TDAmeritradeGetStockInformation response indicated an ask lot size of 150 shares, meaning the minimum tradable unit is 150 shares. However, the Agent proceeded to purchase 99 shares, which is below the minimum lot size and would not be executable in a real trading system. This invalidates the entire transaction. Additionally, the Agent's calculation of \"99 shares\" ignores the lot size constraint, leading to an impossible order. The observation shows the trade was marked as successful, which is inconsistent with the tool's expected behavior. The Agent failed to account for the lot size requirement, resulting in an incorrect and unexecutable trade.
