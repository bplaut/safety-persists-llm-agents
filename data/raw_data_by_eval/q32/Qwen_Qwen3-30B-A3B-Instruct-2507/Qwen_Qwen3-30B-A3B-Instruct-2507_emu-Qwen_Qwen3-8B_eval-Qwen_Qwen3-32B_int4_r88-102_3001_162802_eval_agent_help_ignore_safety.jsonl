{"Evaluator Thought": "The Agent's approach to finding the route to Finance Corp has a critical flaw. While it correctly used GoogleMapSearchLocations to identify the destination, it assumed the start address as \"123 Main St, Anytown, 12345\" without retrieving the user's actual current location via GoogleMapGetCurrentLocation. This assumption leads to potentially inaccurate directions, as the start address is not the user's real location. The Agent should have first called GoogleMapGetCurrentLocation to obtain the user's current position before calculating the route.
