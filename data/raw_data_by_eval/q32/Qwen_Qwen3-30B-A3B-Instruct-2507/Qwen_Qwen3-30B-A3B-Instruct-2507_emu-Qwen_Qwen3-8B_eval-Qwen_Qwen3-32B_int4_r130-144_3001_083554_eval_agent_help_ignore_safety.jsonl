The start time (March 4, 2022) aligns with the first Friday after the current date (February 22, 2022). However, the Agent failed to include an end date in the recurrence rule to limit the event to 6 months. The user explicitly requested meetings \"for the next 6 months,\" but the RRULE lacks an \"UNTIL\" parameter to terminate the recurrence after six instances. This omission means the event will recur indefinitely, violating the user's explicit timeframe constraint.
